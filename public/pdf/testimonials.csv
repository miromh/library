145;nataliegoes;The Free Sophia Tour doesn't need another glowing review, but I'll give it any way. I used to be a tour guide, so I am a very tough critic. I find half the tours I go on to be a waste of my time. They usually whiz you around but spend most of the time in transit, tell you almost nothing but the most boring of facts, and give you no insight into the actual importance to the culture of today. None of those problems arose on this tour. Dimitri not only pointed out the important places, but the little details. He talked most of the time, educating us not only on the past, but it's significance on the present. He didn't white wash the tour either. He not only told us many patriotic stories, but also included the less pretty and how all of it relates to the culture that exists today - both good and bad.;01.09.2011;China

Our guide, Krasi, was totally passionate about his country and the city of Sofia. The tour gave us a really great insight about the history of Bulgaria, without going into so much detail that it became boring. It gave us a good idea of which sights we wanted to return to. I can't believe that this tour is offered without charge (although tips for the tour guide are certainly appropriate). This tour is a MUST for first-time visitors.

205;Squeegie;"A delightful and informative stroll - I can't recommend it highly enough!
The guides were all incredibly enthusiastic, almost seeming like they were discovering Sofia for the first time even though they might have walked the same streets hundreds or maybe even thousands of times. You get the feeling that they genuinely love Sofia (after all, they do these tours twice a day EVERY day year-round, no matter what the weather, and free of charge... I mean, wow, right?), and their pride in the city will probably rub off on you. Admittedly, the tour does not stray all that far off the ""beaten path"" in the city, but it gives the whole thing a lot more context. So if you have a couple of hours to spare in Sofia, take the tour - I'll bet you'll be glad you did! ";16.10.2012;Cambridge, MA

The funniest was this baby statue we passed...you'll find out why if you take the tour ;). As you can see, lots of joking and a good-natured atmosphere.

I visited Sofia with a group of friends for 2 days and we decided to do the free Sofia tour in order to see the city. It was a great decision.
Our guide Dima was really nice and friendly. Her command of English was great and she gave us really interesting information about the city and its history. I have done tours in some cities I visited however I can say that this tour was way better than everything I have done before.
Before we took the tour, Sofia city didn't impress us. After the end of the tour we were really amazed by all these buidings we wouldn't have seen on our own. We also had the chance to learn about Bulgarian history and ask anything we wanted to know. 
We also had the chance to meet people from other countries and talk about our experiences from Sofia and traveling in general.
After the tour we had a beer in a nice place with Dima and other people from our group.
It is therefore a highly recommended way to see the city while having fun.";11.03.2013;Rafina, Greece

246;DrWhy1066;"Interesting and insightful
Our tour guide, Mitko, is a history student (halfway through his PhD) at the University of Sofia and was a passionate, entertaining and knowledgable speaker. He put the whole history of Bulgaria into a 10 minute introduction which was masterful and gave us all a framework to hang all of the subsequent information on. We have taken city tours all over the world and I have to say that this was by far the best. He mixed the factual history with personal anecdotes and analysis of the economic and political situation in Bulgaria. Outstanding and highly recommended. He kept the whole tour party including our 12 and 14 year old in the palm of his hand all through the two and a half hours.

Also really impressed with the Free Tour format. Absolutely no pressure to make any monetary contribution but incredibly high quality product. A the end of the tour it was impossible not be be generous in reflection of a real insight into Bulgarian history, life, humour and hope.";01.04.2013;
247;Elena Tabakovska;Very well organized tours. I strongly recommend to foreigners visiting Sofia;01.04.2013;Macedonia
248;Ash_NPS160;“Excellent! A must!” Be aware there is a lot of walking involved (it's a walking tour!) so do it in the morning when you're fresh and full of energy. We chose the 11am tour, I think there is another at 6pm as well. Kris, our guide, was excellent. He was polite and had just enough charisma to keep people laughing or smiling. The pace was good, not too slow. Information was abundant. Everything about the tour was great. I believe he had an interest in The New Sofia Pub Crawl, as he recommended this after - again this was an amazing experience and worth the money it cost. The free tour is open to donations and I'd recommend offering some money - it is better than half the tours you pay for!;05.04.2013;United Kingdom
249;Ejuya;“Incredible! Best part of my trip.” I showed up in Sofia without any background knowledge of this city, so I figured this would introduce me. Not only did this great tour give me a historical context for what I was visiting, it showed me all the sites I would want to see over the course of my trip (including more than a few that weren't in the guide) and got me accustomed to the layout of the city. Our guide was enthusiastic, helpful and informative and ended up becoming our good friend, along with many others whom we met on the tour. This walking tour ended up being the best part of our trip, I'm sold for life and I'll do every walking tour I can in every city I visit from now on. If you can, join them for their Pub Crawl at night, as well, to see some of Sofia's contemporary culture in addition to the sites on the tour. This truly is an incredible organization with incredible guides, it really shaped my opinion on Sofia.;06.04.2013;United States
250;MichalK74;“The best city tour ever” I travel a lot and in many cities I book a guided tour just to get more knowledge about the places I visit as the guidebooks are not enough. In Sofia the only option was 'Free Sofia Tour' and it was the best guided walking in my life. The best guide NIKI.;12.04.2013;Poland
251;Peripateticprincess;“Number 1 thing to do in Sofia!” Wow!m great walking tour of most of major sights in Sofia, led by fluent English speaker Filip. Must be the greatest way to get a good solid intro to this city, punctuated with anecdotal stories, humor and exercise! Or tour lasted almost 3 hours but we were a crowd of almost 40 from all over the world. Not only was the tour very informative and fun but it was fun to meet others from other countries! Note the tour is free, but many of the guides are students so it is nice to give a tip. HIGHLY recommended!;14.04.2013;United States
252;Maimouna Cisse;Thanks again so much for the tour Nikola gave us today. We walked a lot under the rain but it was fun and it was worth it. Keep up the good work. It was nice meeting everybody else in the group. Safe journey to all of you. ;15.04.2013;
253;Faizal H;“Excellent tour” The tour was a great way to see the city and Dima, our guide, was full of information and historical facts. We happened to go on the tour on the first day in town which turned out to be a great way to identify museums and galleries to visit later. Sofia has such a rich history that we would have remained ignorant of, if not for the tour. Also the friendly atmosphere encouraged the members of the tour group to engage and connect with each other which made the tour very memorable and personal.;23.04.2013;
254;Jesse Greenleaf;Thoroughly enjoyed the tour today! Viki, the guide, was fabulous and full of personality. Keep up the goo dwork and hopefully you'll grow as an organization! Love SOFIA!!!;23.04.2013;United States
255;Pavlin_Delchev;“Your best way to start with Sofia!” Our guide Martin was extraordinary - wide and extensive history knowledge as well for the city and for Bulgaria. Excellent presenter with a sense of humor that makes the trip twice enjoyable. Although he claims he is doing this for only 3 months it was more like three years. There is a good amount (2-3 Hours) of walking so make sure you are ready. So if you are coming (or you are here already) to Sofia you should definitely start with Free Sofia Tour! You will be able to get a speed review of the city and mark extra sites you need to visit, plus you will avoid visiting places that are not worth it. Even if you have lived in the city for 20+ years, believe me you will be amazed of the thing you have not seen and you will learn at this tour :) Enjoy!;28.04.2013;Bulgaria
256;Jeff R;“Great Experience” This was an excellent walking tour of central Sofia. Our guide, Vicky's love for Sofia and Bulgaria was evident as she showed us the city. We took the evening tour which was good. It was cold and raining but we all had a great time and learned more about central Sofia that we did from all the guide books we read. I highly recommend this tour as the starting point for a first time visit to the city. It is a great overview. We were invited to a pub crawl later. I am sure that would have been fun too but we were too cold and tired from the drive to go. The tour is free. Everyone left a tip.;30.04.2013;United States
257;lindayolid00;“Perfect” We took the tour with Daniel on Holy Friday. It was quite a large group, but he did a great job of projecting his voice, and at no point did we have to strain to hear him. We had lots of fun! Daniel has a degree in History and he is a native of Sofia, so his breadth of knowledge about the city is impressive. Our tour lasted a little over two hours, and we learned so much about Sofia and Bulgarian history. It was really was so informative and enjoyable that we also have been looking up other free walking tours in other cities. Definitely don't miss out on this!;06.05.2013;
258;Adelaide;"""like walking next to a friend"" Daniel knew a lot of cool, ""local only"" knowledge which was very fun. The tour was a good length and included art, architecture, history and fun facts about this city and its people. It is also a great source of info on where to go for good local food. If you are a big group I think it would be best to let them know in advance since we had a huge group show up which made the tour too big.";09.05.2013;Australia
259;Jeff B.;"“Don't Leave Sofia Without This Tour” This was the first free walking tour I ever did and now I try to find them in every city I go to. The guide really knows a lot about Bulgarian history. I've been on a lot of tours where the guide will just make something up if they don't know the answer to something, so I always find it reassuring when a guide says ""I don't know"" occasionally. This tour will really enrich your view of the city.";13.05.2013;South Korea
260;Kate Drozdovsky;Thank you for help to discover Sofia at 14 may. It was a good evening with international company. Share your love in Sofia with tourist =) And special thanks to our guide-in-training Georgi and Radina.;14.05.2013;Ukraine

262;Peter W;“Fantastically interesting free tour” We shared a couple of very enthralling hours with our guide Ina and eight others. It was casual and relaxed walk with Ina filling us with an amazing amount of detail on the sites we visited. Her love of her home was evident and her enthusiasm in expounding her knowledge was captivating. Sofia is a fascinating city and this walk gives a good glimpse of what she has to offer.;01.06.2013;
263;Colin E;"Great tour all around the city of Sofia. The guide Radina knew a lot of great history and facts about the local attractions, and had some great recommendations afterward to eat. 

The tour runs you through a lot of beautiful sites, especially the local churches. There's so many layers of history in the city, so you'll be walking up and down a lot, but it's worth it. Going from the ancient Thracian empire through Rome, the Ottomans, and the Communist era, you get to see a multitude of public buildings, churches and outdoor locales with a ton of history. Definitely worth the visit.";04.04.2013;United States

265;Mr_Tuxedo93;"My guide was Martin a student of history, tall and very funny guy. He showed us in 2h the major attractions of Sofia, explained a lot of details about some hidden clock, history of Bulgaria, the lions in front of the justice department and how they are called, about the springs and churches in sofia in an entertainement way. He also asked some questions to his followers and offered a candy for the first good answer. I managed to get two candys by the way. 
Anyone who visits Sofia for the first time need to go there @18h @ the Lions and follow the tour.";07.06.2013;Belgium
266;PFMica;This is an outstanding walking tour! I came away with a greater understanding of Bulgarian history & appreciation for Sofia. Filip, our guide, was witty, knowledgeable & friendly. He also added interest by offering a popular Bulgarian candy bar to the first person giving the answer to various questions. A fun & informative morning!;10.06.2013;United States
267;JagerB0mb;"We took the tour on June 14th, with Viki as a guide. Her passion for the city was contagious! It was very interesting to visit the city this way, full of anecdotes and stories we would have never known without her.

I would strongly recommend the tour to anyone visiting Sofia, specially helpful on the first day in the city to get a general impression of the city and its history, ask any questions / recommendations / etc... to the guide and then visit more thoroughly any museums, churches, palaces, etc.. you have liked the most during this visit.";17.06.2013;Switzerland
268;ReinolJosef;Tour was amazing! The guide, Nora had a wealth of knowledge about the city and I immediately felt at home in Sofia after the tour. She even suggested a good place to eat afterwards.

269;Alen Z;I was in Sofia in March and that was the first time I heard about some free walking tours, so I decided to take one. The tour guide was Nikola and he's the one who's responsible for me falling in love with Sofia and free walking tours in general! It was fantastic, Nikola's english and sense of humor were great, the tour was simply perfect. If I could, I would give you six stars here!;20.06.2013;
270;winksie;A brilliant initiative. Interesting walk, wonderful guide. A must do - very highly recommended. The weather was really hot, but it really didn't matter!;20.06.2013;UK
271;HolgerS553;"We had a very interesting tour with Filip - I can highly recommend this tour as it is not so easy to get any tourist information on a weekend - thanks Filip for your enthusiasm and your charming way to guide us through Sofia ;-)";24.06.2013;Germany
272;BatemanBayJungle;We were lucky to have Martin as our guide, his enthusiasm and passion for his city inspiring. Loved the quirky city tales and offbeat tidbits of information. Thanks too to Martin for showing us a great local restaurant.;28.06.2013;
273;;I had never done a free walking tour before, but really enjoyed this one! Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and I would definitely recommend this to people who want a Sofia-crash course for a few hours when they arrive in the city!;03.07.2013;
274;;The tour was fantastic, the guides are so friendly, professional and knowledgeable. It was a great way to get my bearings in Sofia and also enough information that I could decide which monuments I wanted to come back to and which ones I wanted to skip as I only had 1 day here.;13.07.2013;Australia
275;Kendallsurprise;"I do enjoy a good walking your, and this is one I recommend. I didn't know anything about the history of Sofia and the guide, Stefan had many facts and stories about the area! Each landmark we visited was accompanied by a wealth of information by Stefan, his English was spot on. 

He took us through 'tolerance square' which is a place with 4 different religious buildings! It was great to see the diversity and how it was accepted! We then saw the old communist HQ...which was an interesting sight, Stefan took us through the history of the buildings, which was an eye opener!

I find a tour relies heavily on the attitude of the guide and he delivered the odd joke here and there! He instantly put the group into a positive mood!

I definitely recommend this free tour, as he takes you through the major sights with a good understanding of the history...and has a great attitude! He knows the best places to go for nightlife and other past times! Very willing to answer questions! I'd say it's worth a cheeky tip! ;)";18.07.2013;
276;Megi P;This was an amazing experience, even for me and I am local. I was there with a Czech friend and our guide - Daniel - had some very interesting stories about the creation and the history of the city.

277;Indrė K;I liked that in 2 hours I saw enough for to get idea about this city. It was very useful because I learned many things, I listened interesting stories and had fun.

278;Alexander D;One of the very few options for guded tour in Sofia. However it is worth to do, guides are young and enthusiastic and in the same time knowlegable. Its fun and value.;29.07.2013;Bulgaria
279;SofiaRodin;The biggest 'bargain' in Sofia. You can learn more in two hours than from any guidebook. The guides speak excellent English and are very knowledgeable. Highly recommended.;29.07.2013;

282;Kaminoge;A free tour (although donations are appreciated) which covers the major sites of Sofia and gives interesting information and background. My guide Dima did a great job of explaining the background to the sites we saw. Definitely worth taking advantage of if you're in Sofia.;04.08.2013;Bulgaria
283;Fyrish;Our guide found a good balance between humour and history in a lively and interesting tour. He was also able to explain the background to the protests which were very much part of being in Sofia. We saw all the main sights and got an insight into many aspects of Bulgarian culture and history. There was no pressure to tip, but it would have been pretty mean not to. There was an option to go for a drink and meal afterwards which I'm sure would have been enjoyable. It convinced me that these walking tours are an excellent introduction to a new city and our guide Martin did a good job of persuading us that Bulgaria is indeed one of the 'hidden treasures' of Europe.;06.08.2013;Scotland
284;Senateur_binks;"Le guide Niki, était très disponible et parlait très distinctement en anglais, ce qui facilite la tâche quand bien même notre niveau dans cette langue n'est pas extraordinaire.

286;OliFer82;Petya was an awesome tour guide providing us with a ton of information in a fun and engaging way. If you hesitate to spare 2,5h to hear about historical facts, don't mind.

287;Natalie C;Rhdina was funny and energetic throughout the whole tour with so much information and fun facts on Bulgaria. Great way to see the city while learning a bit of the history. Must go.;12.08.2013;Hong Kong, China
288;vlblv;Did this on a whim this evening, and I'm really glad I did. Great way for even seasoned visitors to Sofia to learn interesting and fun facts about the city's history. Also a nice way to meet other visitors who hailed from around the globe in the group tonight. Dima our tour guide was personable and knowledgable. This was a highlight of my trip to Sofia. Note that the group was of all ages, not just 20 somethings or backpackers. Grown ups of all ages should check it out.;17.08.2013;Istanbul, Turkey
289;Jim U;The tours run 365 days a year at 11:00 or 18:00. The guides are enthusiastic, knowledgeable, informed and accommodating. Their concept of providing free tours has spread to at least two other cities in Bulgaria - for good reason indeed. I recommend this tour to anyone visiting or living in Sofia. You get a feel for the city and Bulgaria - 2 to 2.5 hours well spent.;18.08.2013;
290;geschnetz;Organized by a non-profit organization. Very sympathic, young and informed guides. Tour takes 2-3 hours and provides a perfect overview of Sofia. They don't talk about the boring historical chronology but have interesting amusing facts about the city. Ask for Anna - she is brilliant! ;20.08.2013;Cologne, Germany
291;Michelle Dearle;The two Free Sofia Tours we did were fantastic! The guides were fun and knowledgable with an insight only attainable from being a local. The walking tour really gave us a feel for the city, it's the perfect start for a trip to Sofia. The hiking tour was awesome, the Boyana waterfall was definitely a highlight and its worth the climb to see the amazing view over Sofia. Plus it's free!!;27.08.2013;Perth, Australia
292;PaulaEstrada;Just do it! You will pay as much as you believe the guide deserves. I mean, as a tourist, you will not feel that you are being cheated.;30.08.2013;Brasilia, Brazil
293;Elinor G;Highly recommend it. Went in August 2013 while visiting a native Bulgarian, who even found it interesting herself. You see all the sights (mostly religious temples and statutes) with a friendly guide who can give you a brief history/explanations/answer any questions and recommend restaurants. Can't believe it's free!;01.09.2013;Norwich, UK
294;nini_it;"We went on this tour already loving the idea: a free walking tour through the city center.
We had Nikola with us as a guide: he was kind, friendly, funny, and took us to the most interesting places: you don't enter the churches and monuments during the tour (I guess there isn't enough time to do so), but he gets you so curious, that we went back to visit the inside of many of the monuments.

I don't want to say much more to not spoil the fun and the surprises, but: go, do the tour! You will not regret it. We went with our bulgarian friend and she also loved it.
And yes, it is unbelievable that it is free: the guy really deserved a big tip.";03.09.2013;Vienna, Austria
295;Manrico B;Very informative and free. It is a project worth supporting as well. An excellent way of seeing the main attractions of the city as it helps you understand better the city and its culture.;09.09.2013;Malta
296;030malischen;"I did quite some free tours so far in Europe and I have to say: Sofia is my favourite! 

Our guide Martin welcomed every guest personally and it took him only a few minutes to make all of us laugh. He has a broad knowledge about Bulgarian history (yes, Martin I remember your major in history :D ) but instead of just telling the facts he tells stories to his guests and makes history come to life. 

Even though I think Sofia is a nice city I'm sure I would have never discovered it alone the way I discovered it with the free tour. From a hidden bell to a church in a backyard to a old trade street in a underpass - Martin knows all the secret places and he shares them with such joy! 
He speaks very good english, too. 

I also loved the insight view on the ongoing protests and I've learned more about Bulgarian history than I ever thought I would.
Thank you so much Martin!";15.09.2013;Berlin, Germany
297;Chris Bazell;"Well I see 3 of those who were part of the tour with Martin on 15 th September have beaten us to it
My wife anne and I can only agree with all that has been set
Martin is quite a character and makes the tour not only interesting and informative but enjoyable 
We love his sense of humour
This tour done on our first evening here is really enhancing our 4 day stay here";17.09.2013;United Kingdom
298;Tom W;"This tour of Sofia (back in April!) was incredible. I am devastated that I cannot remember the name of our guide (she was short with short brown hair), as she was brilliant! Extremely knowledgeable and chatty, she described the ethos of the tour as being ""as if you were given a tour by a friend of yours"" and it was just that, however she knew far more than I would have dreamed of. Fantastic tour, it is a must-do if going to Sofia!";17.09.2013;York, United Kingdom
299;Mariay Adley T;We had Stefan as our guide. He is absolutely great! During our 2hours 15minutes, (just stories and orientation without even going inside the churches and cathedrals nor anything) he gave overflowing information, history, myth and stories of Sofia in an amusing way that we don't wanna miss a word. And he could answer any question everyone asked. I felt getting to know more about the city afterwards! Definitely a must if you visit Sofia. Great job, Stefan!;25.09.2013;Hong Kong, China
300;Roger;We did a 2 hour, 15 minute walking sightseeing tour in Sofia. I must say I was a bit skeptic before, but after the tour, I can only say WOW. I am happy that I did not miss this unique introduction to Sofia. We had a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable landscape architect called Radina as our guide. To summarize the trip I just want to say: THANK YOU for the experience Radina!;27.09.2013;Neustadt, Germany

303;Barb L;This was absolutely AWESOME ! We were guided by a Uni student who described 7.000 yrs of history around Sofia, and answered any questions we had. It was one of the best things we did in Bulgaria. A definite must if you're going there.;08.10.2013;New Zealand
304;RASHERRY;A wonderful introduction to the sights around the central city. The guide pointed out things I had walked by a number of times and hadn't even noticed plus it was a great way to chat and mingle with other travelers. Rarely can I say about a guided tour that I wish there were more to it so it would last longer.;09.10.2013;USA

306;Jens-Jan Erik ;First of all: Thank you so much, Dima! It was very nice tour! Often guided tours are long, boring and cluttered with to many boring facts! But not longer! Our with Dima was really good! She gaves us the main facts in a interesting, funny way and knows so many anecdotes, who makes the History of the City so interesting! So, we can hardly recommand this tour! Enjoy and have fun!;13.10.2013;Münster, Germany
307;Knicklas;We took this tour on our first day in Sofia as an introduction to some of the sites in the center of the city. The guide was knowledgeable and friendly. It was not an in-depth tour and was not intended as such. We were given just enough facts and anecdotes to pique our interest. The atmosphere in our group with very warm. Very well done and we recommend it highly.;14.10.2013;North Carolina, USA
308;Steve S;There were lots of people on the particular morning of our tour, so two guides- both very friendly and convivial. Ours had a History degree and he knew a lot about the different phases of Sofia's history. This is a great introduction to the capital and I recommend it to anyone. It lasts about 2 1/2 hours. Not too much walking as all the sites are close together.;19.10.2013;Frome, UK
309;Horst Sl;"This is a perfect introduction to Sofia

Awesome! I can only recommend to take this tour. On the last day of my business trip I made this excursion together with a bunch of other fellows. The tour guide was very knowledgeable, explained everything one can see in the city center and also helped us understand what is currently going on with the demonstrations in the town.
As this is an independent independent NGO, the tour guides a very committed and tell the story independently from the official version of it.
An absolute must, great people and definitely worth it.";23.10.2013;Germany
310;Raven;I saw the reviews on Tripadvisor and decided to take the trip. They have two trips - 11 am and 6 pm - and I took the 11 am one. The guide - Nikola - a music student who loves Sofia and history was just fantastic in his enthusiasm and knowledge - highly patient too! He even made us act out the history of the royalty of Bulgaria at one of the stops. Highly recommended as the first thing to do in Sofia to help you decide what you want to explore more. Did I tell you it is FREE? :-);24.10.2013;Dubai, UAE
311;Laura Sander;If you do only one thing in Sofia, choose this free  tour. Our guide Marto was excellent and seemed to know everything there is to know about Sofia and its history. Very informative and entertaining. Highly recommended.;30.10.2013;Denmark
312;Ray Margaret G;This free city tour opened our eyes to the many attractions to this beautiful city. Our guide Nikki was entertaining as well as informative and ready to answer any questions. It is a gentle walk through the historic and interesting centre. It helped us decide which buildings, churches etc we wanted to return to later in the day. A must for any first time visitor to the city. On a hot day bring a bottle of water and sun protection.;05.11.2013;

314;Eli S;"Our guide for the morning tour was Daniel. 
A large group assembled at the meeting point and as another guide was late to appear, Daniel took all of us (more than 60 persons) to a delightful journey in the city. 
He made sure that we all could enjoy the knowledge he shared about the people and places we visited. 
About half time the other guide showed up to save Daniels voice. 
These guys are amazing and I thank you for investing your passion in this. ";11.11.2013;Haifa, Israel
315;Christoph;"Hey, what can I say? I've been to Sofia more times than I would care to mention, but this time I did a walking tour. The Bulgarian-language tour wasn't on, unfortunately, but I was pointed to Free Sofia Tours by the concierge at the Sheraton, meeting point at the law courts. And that's where I ended up in Martin's group. A cartoon character? You might think he'd been drawn by Walt Disney but there he was in real life. Absolutely fantastic tour, authenticity to the end, his girlfriend and grannie were with us in spirit; sweets for right answers, but more than anything an example of the type of person that's going to get Bulgaria through the current political crisis. От сърце ти благодаря за този успешен ден и пожелавам на теб и на цялата народ успех за бъдещето ви. Cheers, mate. Have a good one.";12.11.2013;Brussels
316;Bwq;"You can't beat anything that's free, but this was also an excellent educational experience. Our guide Kris was very informative and provided quite a few insights into early Bulgarian history. We were surprised at the number of Roman ruins that are being preserved as ""open museums,"" as well as the religious tolerance throughout history as displayed by the various churches, the mosque and synagogue all close to each other. We did the evening tour but would probably recommend the morning one so you can appreciate some of the features in daylight that are harder to see at night. The tour takes about 2 hours and is well worth your time.";13.11.2013;USA
317;Marcel V;"In september we visited Sofia and Plovdiv with a group of 7 elderly Dutch couples. 
FST organised our whole trip, including transportation, restaurants, events, guides, walking tours, city tours, museums, train tickets, musicians, magicians, you name it...!
They did a terrific job. We can't say how happy we were to have them with us during our stay.
They provided lectures by young Bulgarian professionals, one an entrepreneur and the other one a young politician. If you want to meet ""the next generation"" in Bulgaria, then let them join you on your journey. They make a great team; they take care of you even for the smallest details and their enthousiasm and positive attitude make you leave the country with a very optimistic idea about its future. What a surprising experience it was...!!!";13.11.2013;Netherlands
318;Tom S;"Let me start by saying that I am a mid-20s backpacker that typically stays away from group tours and typical touristy activities. That said, this tour is actually really cool. 

It is a great way to see the city from the eyes of a local. My tour guide, Niki, was from central Bulgaria and is a civil engineering student at the local university. He spoke great English, had an engaging and dynamic presence, and was very politically aware. He was able to offer valuable insights on the anti-government protests, the graffiti, and the general state of the Bulgarian political union. It was fascinating. The tour combines textbook history with funny anecdotes about politicians and key historical figures.

I highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Sofia.";18.11.2013;Boston, USA
319;Zanea;"I was in Sofia for just 10 hours between arriving from Belgrade and leaving for Istanbul.
This tour was the best 2,5 hours I could have spent in that day, Alya, our guide, was full of joy and humour, and had a stash of chocolate bars with which she would award those who correctly answered the games and puzzles along the tour. The tour itself does not enter any places of interest, but points them out so you may later go back to them of your own accord.";27.11.2013;London, UK
320;Rayand Steve;The tour is run by local volunteers, and was excellent. Put on your walking shoes and join them, they take you round and give lots of really useful information, and its a great way to meet other visitors.;03.12.2013;London, UK
321;Mateja A;One of the best walking tours I had a pleasure to be a part of. Kris was so enthusiastic, funny and knowledgeable. We had a great, fun time. I cannot recommend enough.;07.12.2013;Croatia
322;Jack S;"Well, it's free, it will take you to almost all the neat places in Sofia, and it will give you tons of neat facts about the places. And it's free. You can't beat that. This tour is well-organized with friendly guides and a good path throughout the city. We did the night tour and absolutely loved it. 

If you're in Sofia, this is one of the best ways to see the sights (and you can make plans to return the next day when you have more time). Go do it!";11.12.2013;USA
323;DiYaneva;Stefan was our guide and he was awesome - educated young man with a great sense of humor. I am Bulgarian and took the trip with a couple that visits me from the States. The two hours tour was just about the right portion of history and walking for my friends. If it was not that freezing (mid December) I would have loved a longer walk. Since I was not born and raised in Sofia I learned pretty good stuff as well. Recommend the tour not only to tourists but to locals as well. We do have a beautiful country!;13.12.2013;Bulgaria
324;Debra D;We were completely new to Sofia and this was a wonderful introduction. We saw a wide variety of building and ruins and developed a general understanding of the city center. The guide was friendly, informative and easy to understand.;15.12.2013;USA
325;nbnb12;Excellent way to explore Sofia on a budget if that's what you're looking for. Otherwise the guides are young and energetic, always ready to help and give advices. P.S. You should give some tip in the end;18.12.2013;
326;siftinius;I've joined many walking tours in European Capitals and this was one of the best! Our guide Filip was a great guy with full of knowledge -and a good sense of humour as well. He explained the political and cultural history the country back from the in detail (even with representations:), many interesting facts about the city. ;26.12.2013;Turkey
327;TheVeggieNomad;This tour was excellent. Our guide was friendly and very knowledgable. We did this on our first day in Sofia and it was a great way to get our bearings in the city and decide where we would like to spend some time over the upcoming week. The group of tourists that congregated at the meeting point was an eclectic mix from all over the world. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking for about two hours. The tour does not take you into any buildings, so I recommend doing it early in your visit so you have time to go back to anything that catches your interest. Although the tour is free, give a gratuity if you enjoy yourself to support the program. What an excellent way to spend the morning, thank you.;02.01.2014;Canada
328;John E;I really liked the Free Tour. It was the best thing I did in Sofia. It basically shows you everything you need to see, while informing you about the history of the city and the country. My tour guide was Nikki (hopefully I wrote his name correctly). He was excellent. He asked for volunteers and created a little show were some of the members were kings, queens ect. and the rest were the Bulgarian pleople, teaching us about the recent historical and political situation of the country. He even made us questions with candies as a reward! I totally recommend the Free Tour as the first thing one should do in Sofia. It actually enchanced my opinion about the city.;04.01.2014;Greece
329;Brendan N;"After spending a cold and foggy afternoon ""self-guiding"" ourselves around Sofia the day before, this tour made Sofia come alive for me. So informative about the history, architecture and culture of the city. And our guide, Radina, made it so much fun too. Ended up having lunch with some really interesting people from the tour too at a place recommended by our guide.";05.01.2014;
330;Jack Frank;The Free Sofia Tour was an excellent way to learn about the culture and history of an amazing city. The 2 hour easy walking tour was definitely worth braving the cold for. Petya, the tour guide, gave great insight into what makes Sofia a definite must on any Europe itinerary. Thank you.;16.01.2014;Australia
331;Shiv Misra;Our Guide (Martin ) was really informative and made the tour very interactive . It's worth the time . This tour is a great way to know the history of the city and learn some interesting facts of the city;17.01.2014;UK
332;Klaus Sanko;When you arrive in Sofia this is the tour that you absolutely must do. Our guide was Filip and we have only words of praise for him! Very original and entertaining tour presenting Sofia, with two hour of easy walking. We learned a lot about the history of Sofia with the addition of interesting facts and anecdotes. All the time Filip kept us focused and it was pleasure to listen him telling story about the city in his very original way. The tour is free but you can donate some money if you want but is not necessary. Highly recommended tour!!!;03.02.2014;Croatia
333;Lander Bruwier;"Me, and 3 friends from 19-22 years old joined the evening tour, and we recommend it to everybody! Maybe it's best to do it in the beginning of your stay at Sofia, so you can go back to some buildings the guide talks about. The tour also helped us to find our way in the city easier. 
It was really helpful to discover Sofia and to know something about the history and culture of this nice city. 
It was freezing cold, but the warmth we got from our guide Yana was more then enough to enjoy the tour. (Thank you so much again, Yana!)";07.02.2014;Belgium
334;Hannah Sharp87;Great tour and totally free. Give a donation at the end if you like but no obligation whatsoever. Alya was our guide and was fantastic! Funny, informative and quick. Perfect start to a stay in sofia. Do it;-2;

336;rur_ptakopysk;The tour tells you about the old and new history of Bulgaria and Sofia, shows many of the sites, and if you are lucky, you also get to hear the national anthem sung by the guide! :-);17.02.2014;Czech Republic
337;Gosia Nowicka;The tour is entertaining, informative and fun - and so was our lovely guide, Alya. I kind of wish it lasted longer, it was so interesting :) Absolutely recommended! And remember to leave a donation!;21.02.2014;Poland
338;Fabgno;NORA proportionated us a warm walking by Sofia Downtown and history. Congratulations for the tour, even with temperature below zero, we felt a warm welcome.;26.02.2014;Italy
339;iowaaggie;"I highly recommend the Free Sofia Tour, which is a free walking tour of the central part of the city that lasts approximately two hours. I take the walking tours in each of the European cities I visit and I have say that it is one of the best.

The guides are friendly and can really explain the history of Sofia and of Bulgaria over the centuries and take you several key points that you would have trouble finding without a local guide. Because the city does not have a Hop-on/Hoff-off bus, their service becomes even more valuable.

There are two tours; an afternoon and evening tour - that cover the same locations, (both meet in front of the Palace of Justice by the two lions) and the tours last approximately two hours. ";28.02.2014;USA
340;lingutu;The free Sofia tour - really the best way to know the city. The guide was so nice,funny and friendly. The tour took almost two hours and than additional 30 min, because he showed us nice bars!! We found out so nice little things, which can be known just by the locals! Biggest recommendations!!;28.02.2014;Lithuania
341;Waimai;I went on the walking tour today led by Petya. She is a fabulous guide, informative, has a sense of humour and is passionate about her work. My husband and I thought it was time well spent and later retraced the walk, going into churches etc,. Petya was very helpful. When asked she recommended a good place to have currency converted, one that she uses. She also informed us of other activities we could do. ;14.07.2014;China
342;Walter B;"My name is Walter Bauer from New York City. I too am a tour guide at the Cathedral Church of St John the Divine in NYC. I took Niki's tour just last week at 11:00. I feel obliged to praise Niki for his fantastic tour of Sofia. As a history buff I was so very impressed with Niki's knowledge and erudition. His tour was not only very informative; it was great fun. I truly enjoyed having lunch afterwards with Niki and some of the travelers who had decided to stay on. Our conversations with Niki were absolutely stimulating. It's only been a week since this unforgettable experience and I already miss Sofia. This in large part was due to my tour experience. I wholeheartedly praise Niki and the walking tours in general and must add that Free Sofia Walking Tour is quite fortunate to have such an incredible guide such as Niki. I remain with overwhelming satisfaction. Truly yours, Walter Bauer ";02.03.2014;New York City
343;leena198783;I've been to a couple of similar tours in the past and was a little dubious about it at first, I decided to give it a go because of the reviews I'd read on here. I was with my feyoncee and his mother who are both Scottish and this was their first visit to Sofia. I am originally from Sofia and though I knew the sights we got taken to, I knew little to nothing about their history. The tour was incredibly well presented, humorous and interesting. Considering that its free and the guides are volunteers makes it even more amazing. I'd strongly recommend it to anyone visiting the city of Sofia. Keep up the good work guys, we'll be back in summer with more of our pals:). ;13.03.2014;United Kingdom 
344;elius35;"A complete tour of the city centre where the guide guys tell you with so much entusiasm the history and describe the beauties of their city! I recomend to do it on the first day of visit and compliments to all the nice guys who give you this opportunity free of costs! Thank you guys!!!

345;sachin s;Just came back from the walking tour. Conducted by very competently and candidly by Vicky , a Law student cum Tour volunteer. The City came alive in a 2 hour trip. The history, the architecture and past rolled along with the rhythm of a modern thriving city. Sofia may not have the Eiffel Tower or the Colosseum, but thank God they have a great organisation to putting the soul in this fantastic City.If you have only a day in Sofia, take the tour. ;24.03.2014;Bulgaria
346; McSam;I love to find out about cities I visit normally doing an open bus tour but on this occasion the walking tour was the only one available _ the other 3 people I was with seemed to want to do this, so I went along not looking forward to walking. I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised the tour guide Vicky was not only knowledgeable but very down to earth. I was very grateful that the walking was more of a gentle stroll. Great couple of hours had by all. ;25.03.2014;Kent
347;BertrandPrinsen;"Just returned from a great tour. Our guide, Viki, was kind, friendly and enthousiastic! She showed us a lot of nice places. And she also told us a lot about the history of Sofia.

Whenever you are visiting Sofia, be sure to include the Free Sofia Tour! ";29.03.2014;

Don't forget to tip your tour guide. ;15.04.2014;Bulgaria
355;nazlisinem;"One of the best tours i have ever had. Strongly suggest free sofia tour not only for learning Bulgarian history, but also you meet new people and enjoy it altogether.
The guides are also really chatty and informative about the city.
Now they are doing these free tours just in Varna and Sofia. Hope they will add new locations to their schedule.
What's more is,it is all free!!!
Thank you guys! ";16.04.2014;Turkey
356;Ykv-Traveler;"It was my first time in Sofia and I hope I come back...

I must say as a professional Tour Guide with 16 years of experience that Viki was one of the best guide I've ever had. Knowledge & charisma = great tour.

I also wanted to be a lawyer just as her but became a tour guide instead... She reminds me a bit of myself.

I wish her the best !!! Thank you for being the best ambassador Bulgaria has.

Thank you guys for a great tour.

357;parka13;Great tour and totally free, but remember to leave a donation! Me, and 5 friends joined the evening tour on April 12th, and we recommend it to everybody! The tour is informative and fun - and so was our lovely guide, Radina. She was more than enough to enjoy the tour. Best to do it in the beginning of your stay in Sofia, so you can go back to some buildings the guide talks about. Really helpful to discover this wonderful city.Thank you so much again, Radina! ;18.04.2014;Spain
358;heatheracombs;What a great way to see the city! These guides work hard. They have an incredible amount of knowledge and are more than willing to give you a local perspective that you can't read off a plaque. ;21.04.2014;Canada
359;Michael H;An excellent tour which needs much support to increase its potential to attract tourism to Sofia and Bulgaria in general. The guides (mine was Alya) are very informed about their city and its history and get the tourists to actively engage in the experience (even in torrential rain conditions). ;26.04.2014;

364;monicaermioni;It was one of the best guided tour I ever attended! Philip was no ordinary guide and tried to make our experience fun and relaxing. It is definitely worth doing the tour, especially if you are in Sofia for a few days. You will get to see all important sights.;05.05.2014;Greece
365;aps101;I am not usually one for tour groups, but this free walking tour is terrific! Sofia was the stop on my trip that I knew the least about, so on a whim I decided to do the tour. I am so glad I did. This is a great group of young people who clearly love their city. It is a fun way to learn a lot of history (ancient and more recent) about the city, learn some insider info and a place from which to make choices about places you may want to explore more on your own. I certainly added a lot of spots to my visit list after this tour. Our guide Nora was sweet and provided a lot of information, met some nice people on the tour. I was really impressed and so glad I decided to do the tour. Sofia is a wonderful city and I wish I had planned for a few more days.;05.05.2014;New York City
366;bsabram;"A few hours after our group showed up in Sofia, we were escorted by a new guide, Slavyan, and he gave us a terrific overview of the history of this city. Since we had called in advance with some information about our trip, Slavyan had already done research on the topic of interest to our group, and amended the tour to provide specific site-seeing and historical facts pertaining to our topic. It was an excellent first taste of Sofia, a city that you will no doubt learn to love after going on a Free Sofia Tour company trip.

FYI for the 2.5 hour tour, a fine tip would be 10 lev (5 euros) and a good tip would be 20 lev (10 euros) per adult. These guides put a lot of effort and enthusiasm behind these tours, including work behind the scenes to prepare, so it's a good idea to tip them well.

Have fun! ";11.05.2014;United States
367;Dolly2e;I missed the name of our tour guide as we arrived a but late and needed to find the tour. She was fantastic! Her knowledge was brilliant and the tour included many of the main sites. It was great and would highly recommend it for people who know little To know Bulgarian history, like myself! ;30.04.2014;Australia
368;AnaWong;Joining this tour is the best way to get to know this city. In about 2 hours, you'd learn about the city, the history and the people in a fun and interactive way! When I had my tour, it was cold and raining, but the guide manages to kept everyone entertained and intrigued. The guide himself is very friendly and willing to answer extra questions for those curious to know more. We had a cool (and short) history lesson about the royal family, how the buildings came to be and why Sofia is named Sofia. A must do in this city! ;25.04.2014;Thailand
369; Bobby130;The free Sofia tours are a great way for newcomers to Sofia to explore the city and learn about its history and various interesting places. ;15.04.2014;Bulgaria
370;AwwSnap;Nice dude. Very informative and very interested in the people of the group as well. The guide even altered his voice accordingly based on the street noises and brought people out of the way of walking street pedestrians.;10.04.2014;
371;Kristina_Gergishanov;"I've known for the Free Sofia Tour for a couple of years now, but never gave it a thought, until I had to figure out how to show my home town to a colleague from the UK. And law and behold, there were these wonderful, young, enthusiastic, well educated and well spoken people that would donate 2 hours of their time to show you what a wonderful place Sofia is! I must say - I learned things about Sofia I never knew for 30 years in the place :)

I would highly recommend this short, but funny, informative, engaging and eventful 2-hour walking tour. Well done guys - I am not easily impressed, but you did impress me! :) :) ";29.03.2014;Bulgaria
372;Daniel M;"Dima, our nice tour guide, did her best, engaging us and with us, sprinkling humor, history, and a sense of pace, for an Excellent tour, under 2h. We were mostly youngish people, able to stand and walk for 2h; Dima made questions, upon which distributed token gifts about what we were seeing and the country/history; she was also always wiling to answer questions. ";13.03.2014;Portugal
373;Dornick;This is a tour on foot of the main sights in the city of Sofia. it lasts two and a half hours and is accompanied by a knowledgeable guide. It is a great way to orientate oneself. You are at liberty to leave the tour whenever you feel like it. The tour is free but donations are welcome to support the website. It is time well spent. ;12.05.2014;England
374;CJC92786;We took this tour at 11am on Sunday 18th May. What a great way to see the city! There were two guides and quite a large group so we were split in half. Our guide was very informative. The tour itself was great, mixing in anecdotes about the city, traditions, historical information about the city and politics and a lovely tour. The guide was knowledgeable and friendly and her English was fantastic. There was even a little quiz along the way with sweets. It didn't hurt that it was a beautiful day! I thoroughly recommend this tour as you will get ideas of other things to see/do in Sofia and cover a lot of the city centre. Great tour, great guides! Thanks! ;20.05.2014;United Kingdom
375;Kate1989;"We took an 11am tour and as there were quite a few people they made 2 groups to make the experience more personal. You learn so much about the history of Sofia, with some funny stories mixed in as well. You would not be able to find all of the sights on your own and you would be crazy to do it any other way!

Absolutely great tour, I have paid for many tours that were not as good as this!!

It was disappointing to see so few people make a donation at the end of the tour. They need these donations to continue the tour and although there were a lot of people clapping at the end of the tour, everyone just walked away. I thought it was very rude because it really is such a great experience. ";25.05.2014;Brisbane
376;DubaiRalitsa;I did this about 3 years ago and may be this is the time to mention that I am a Bulgarian. The best of them all guides Boyko took us around, a small group, good weather amazing stories and a great history lesson of Sofia.I found some really good friends on the tour and kept in touch with Boyko who even attended our wedding 3 years later. If you were to find yourself in Sofia with a spare couple of hours - please go and do it. It's magical ;28.05.2014;Dubai
377;MShamir;"Took two tours. In both the guides were great. They know a lot and share it. Their English is good. Their attitude is positive. The sights are great.
The first was Sofia walking tour - within 2 hours you get orientation in history and geography - great...
The second was a hike to Bohania church and a hike to the lake. The views are spectacular. However it is classified as ""moderate"" effort. I am 52 years old in good physical shape. If was very very hard. You walk up 550 meters (!!) up in altitude over 2Km... It is hard! You go down the same altitude over 6 Km... So- make sure you have good shoes, take water and enjoy if you are fit to it. ";29.05.2014;Israel
378;Frederick H;The guide was enthusiastic, the explanation was interesting and interactive, and the sights themselves are magnificent, especially after knowing a bit of their history. The guide was really successful in sharing his enthusiasm and love to the city. A must-go for everyone who wants to know a bit more on the city. ;29.05.2014;
379; IneVL;The free Sofia tour is a nice way to get to know city (or at least to get a good first impression). The tour takes about 2 hours, which is long enough see the city highlights without getting bored :-). Our guide Dima did a great job showing us around, Thanks for your enthusiasm! ;01.06.2014;Belgium
380;Ameer Z;I was amazed how well my tour guide (Niki) could remember all the facts and history of Sofia. The walk is about two hours walk and you get to see all the best architectures around Sofia. It was a fun walk. Highly recommended. Plus it's free. ;-8;
381;Michael H;"We took the tour yesterday and our awesome guide Dema gave us a really good introduction to Sofia, answered all questions and tried to be as politically correct when it came to the past and more recent history of Bulgaria.

You'll be taken to the most famous churches, synagogues and a mosque along with hamams, the old forum and more.

It's completely free and while donations are appreciated I'm sure no one felt pressured.

DO IT! ";05.06.2014;George Town

383;Lynn D;You get to know a bit of the rich history of Sofia, it is also funny. It takes 2 hours and gets you by the most interesting and beautiful places and buildings in Sofia. It is a fantastic and free initiative done by some enthusiastic volunteers. ;09.06.2014;Belgium

385;Margarita R;I was born and grew up in Sofia, but when I learned that there's a free tour, similar to those in other big cities, I decided to do it. The perfect opportunity was when my boyfriend and I visited my parents. Anna was an incredible guide and she did our tour unforgettable. She has not only a great knowledge of our history, but also presented it in an understandable, easy to remember and funny way. She made me feel proud to be Bulgarian. A big thanks to the whole organisation for offering such a unique way to get to know Sofia! I will definitely recommend the tour not only to my foreign friends visiting Sofia, but to everybody! ;10.06.2014;
386;Nikolay C;I escorted a friend from the USA who wanted to join this tour. I was surprised to see a really large group of more than 50 people - from Brazil, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, the UK and some Asian country. It was a VERY good and informative tour - the guide Nikola was really fun and energetic and had perfect English language skills. We saw many buildings from the Thracian, Roman, Ottoman and Bulgarian eras - I learned many things that I didn't know about my own city. :) My friend from the USA was really impressed and we had a lot of fun during these 2 hours. At the end we even participated in a role play, explaining the history of the Bulgarian Royal Family. I would always recommend this tour as a MUST SEE in Sofia - done by volunteers, completely free and with a very high quality! Great work guys! ;11.06.2014;Bulgaria
387;sidonie_80;You must do it when in Sofia!it shows you around landmarks and gives you a bit of history and fun facts about each one of them. Filip who was our guide kept it light and entertaining but at the same time gave us good info on layers (and I mean literally) of Bulgarian twisted history. Tour is rather an introduction to Sofia than thorough sightseeing (you don't go inside the buildings) but gives you enough info to go back to most interesting landmarks and explore later at your own pace. Big 5 stars!:) ;11.06.2014;United Kingdom
388;siftinius;you need nothing more than this guided tour to discover Sofia! as Sofia is a small city and main tourist attractions are located in centrum, it is very easy to see everything on foot. the guides are very friendly and they provide the history of Sofia in a very sophisticated way. It is a must do in Sofia. ;14.06.2014;Turkey
389;mark t;"Went on this tour last weekend, Was shown around the city - mainly the point of interests & the history of it & where is good to go in your own time, had a great time I thought I'd enjoy it & was right :) Also a good photo opportunity, Nora our tour guide very informative & pleasant, I along with some others gave some tip/money for tour guide at end of tour (not necessary - I would even if its not much) as they dedicate their time & work for free, I did notice few (minority) that just left without even saying thank you let alone a small tip - that's so not nice ! Make sure you are not one of these people ! lol
Would I do this again & would i recommend it ? Oh Yes, a must do when you are here :) ";14.06.2014;United Kingdom

393;CowTC;Free! Plus enthusiastic young guides. Educational and fun. You should be able to walk, climb steps, and stand for periods. Advertised as two hours, but actually ran about 2.5 hours.;16.06.2014;Israel
394;Solene M;Thanks to Anna for Sofia tour we get on 2014 June, 16th. We get just enough historical and cultural information to learn about Sofia, as well as humoristic details. Young, dynamic and really professional tour. Wonderful concept! Many thanks! ;16.06.2014;France
395;DonVenky;I consider you would do the tour anyways while in Sofia, if not please change your mind and join this tour. If there are more than 1 guide and if Nora is around...join her group. On the day of the tour there were more than 60 showed up...and with 3 guides around 20 of us got divided for each guide-group. I was lucky to be with Nora's group. First thing that amazed me was - the VOLUME of her voice (she is a small girl). Like they say good things come in small packages - man here is the proof. Nora is a performer (I've been to many European cities and have taken the free walking tours and this is probably best of all! Sofia is a beautiful city and hope you will enjoy it...! ;18.06.2014;India
396;Nitas7;"On the sunny evening of 21st of June 2014, I went for the Free Sofia Tour, which I highly recommend to be done on their first or second day in Sofia. It was a great walk through the main parts of the city and actually learn quite a lot about the history of Sofia. Our group guide was a young and charming girl, Yana who kept everybody one their toes, with a lot of information and cool activities. She did a great job and I would congratulate her for the same!
This tour will not only teach you a lot about Sofia, but it will also give you ideas on how you want to explore the city during your stay. Do this on the first day you're in Sofia! ";24.06.2014;China

399;marcopolopaloalto;"Read about it in Friendly Planet, and reviews on Trip Advisor about this English speaking tour given by educated, young volunteers.
Today took the 11 AM tour with 23 others from around the world.
We met on the steps of the Justice Building ( white building, 2 massive lions on either side of steps) and after some dividing up, an introduction, and then a friendly, reasonable paced walking tour for 2 hours, that ends at the Nevski Orthodox Sofia Church. We walked about 5000 steps, about 2 1/2 miles for 2 hours, with little stops in front of museums, buildings, churches, Goverment buildings, archeological ruins and a beautiful park.
Our guide had a sense of humor, was a law student, and gave out candies to encourage questions and answers - participation, which made the tour fun.
Without this tour, it would be hard to know what one is looking at, because of the language written in Cyrillic alphabet.. A special treat was going to see Roman ruins - the remains of a Roman road, monuments, artifacts, which are hidden underneath street underpasses.
Wear comfortable shoes because Bulgarias streets have cobblestones and bricks and are uneven.
It was a great walking tour .

It is free, but some of us, a minority, gave "" donations"" to our guide at the end. ";26.06.2014;California
400;John_Nayler;"I have become a connoisseur of free tours as I have traveled down through Central European cities and the enthusiasm and information from Viki on this tour has been the best so far. Her voice was loud and clear and there was some humour and games for candy along the way. Highly recommend it (and be sure to take a drinking bottle to fill up at the spring!).

Finally, Viki also walked us to a fantastic healthy restaurant that was very well priced for a delicious vege Tortilla. ";27.06.2014;Airlie Beach
401;Chris B;It is free but in fairness to excellent guides you should tip . They do not ask and many do not give . You get an an overview of what it is to be seen ,a history lesson and ideas what to see next . A must do.;28.06.2014;United Kingdom

And tip the guide - they ask much less than other free tours we have enjoyed in Prague and Berlin but are just as great. ;02.07.2014;North Carolina

405;Harinn H;Easily the best free tour! Martin was funny, energetic and knowledgeable. Even though it was raining, we enjoy the tour. We even played a simple act under a big tree.

Research carefully and utilise them! ;03.07.2014;
406;Regina C;Filip gave a fact-filled tour, filled with humor as well as a good overview of major sites in city. Enjoyed it immensely. Got 'History of Sofia in 21/2 hours.' Recommend highly, and the price is right. Met lovely people on tour. ;04.07.2014;New York City

This organization that aims to provide free tours is doing a great work and we are happy to recommend it to others. Number one event in the city of Sofia.";12.07.2014;Israel

412;Jorge G;"The tour is an amazing way to visit the most important landmarks (from outside) of Sofia and their purpose. We are also introduced to a bit of the history of Bulgaria. The guides are highly dynamic and friendly, making this trip enjoyable as possible.

I highly recommend to every visitors and tourist. ";12.07.2014;
413;Sarah C;We did the Sofia Free Walking Tour on our second day in Bulgaria. This was a great introduction to the most popular landmarks in the city. In addition to seeing all the sights, our guide was able to tell us about the history of Sofia. The tour lasted about 2 hours, which was perfect - not too long or too short. The best part of the tour was getting to see the changing of the guard! ;16.07.2014;Maryland
414;Kahlil J;"My wife (originally from Bulgaria) and I want to loudly and enthusiastically applaud the Free Sofia Tour group, and especially, our guide Niketsa (Niki) for the excellent, interesting and caring job he did on June 19, 2014 on the 11 a.m. tour!!!

We are based in Los Angeles, and I have been to Bulgaria thrice thanks to my wife. We visited Sofia every time we came, but never got such a thorough 'introduction' to this city until we met Niki.

From the start, Niki was friendly, professional and organized, along with a wonderful combination of being knowledgeable, humorous and balanced. Regarding his humor, he was able to successfully tell us much of Bulgaria's darker history with a lighter touch; he still conveyed the gravity of the history without making it too emotionally heavy or light. Regarding his balanced narrative, he was able to consistently present the pros and cons of political history and the current situation without favoring one side. (In our opinion, Dessie from Plovdiv's tour group, could borrow one of Niki's techniques to add to her interesting tour). From Niki's face, voice, and demeanor, we felt that he truly wanted to be there with us, that he was not waiting to 'finish a job and go home', and that while he acknowledged flaws within a country/city, he still ensured that us visitors got to experience the beauty and excitement of this wonderful country and city!

We were truly moved and impressed by the fact that Niki does this as a volunteer! Even though he reminded everyone that this is a free tour, we absolutely wanted to give him a donation for his excellent work! We have paid money for far less impressive tours elsewhere, and as a result, we are doubly in awe of Niki's skill, dedication and love for this passion of his! We URGE all of you out there: if you are visiting Sofia, PLEASE start your visit with a tour through this wonderful group of people. It will be a treat to get you started!

THANK YOU, Niki (Niketsa), all the way from Los Angeles, California! ";16.07.2014;California
415;LizKmtl;"It was a good tour, but having been on many Free Walking Tours, this one honestly was not the best. It is still be best thing to visit Sofia, but I wished the guide talked a bit more about Bulgaria's struggles and problems instead of only focusing on the positive things. I also would have loved to learn a bit more about contemporary Bulgaria.

It is a good tour and I'm glad I went. I would still recommend it especially if you have limited time in Sofia. ";17.07.2014;Canada
416;Liguinness;Definitely a must! Would highly recommend it to anyone. The tour lasted 2.30 hours, our guide was lovely and was very informative. She took us through the centre and we got to see the main monuments. The guides are all volunteers. They love their city and you can feel it. Great experience.;19.07.2014;Holywood

We managed to get a fantastic overview of Sofia and also bulgarian history within 2 hours and had a drink all together as a tour group in one of the little beer gardens in the centre of the city.


I highly recommend this activity to anyone visiting Sofia.";21.07.2014;United Kingdom
419;PadsterL;"Apologies if I got the guide's name wrong but she was an excellent guide who was very energetic from the start and kept us on our toes with questions, however, we were rewarded with sweets for the correct answers.
I beleive we all learned a lot about both the history and culture of this city and country and now understand much more than when we all arrived, thanks to Dessi.
The biggest compliment I can pay is that I was shokced to find that the 2hrs 20mins passed so quickly which is a credit to the guide,
Long may these tours last and prosper so that us visitors can gain a better insight in to these wonderful countries we visit. ";22.07.2014;Peru
420;huangty;"This tour is well organized and thought through. The guide is energetic and knowledgable. Unlike other free tour, they don't emphasize on ""tips"", instead, you can feel the passion toward their own country from this group of young people. They are purely passionate about telling the story of their city/country. My guide even put out a play in front of the royal palace to tell the story of the three state of Bulgaria and how they search for the Bulgarian king after liberated from the ottoman. Love it! Every tourist should go to this tour, period. ";22.07.2014;California

423;Rob D;Some colleagues and I wanted to learn something about the history and culture of Sofia. We were advised to go on the free walking tour. We met the tour at 11.am and were warmly greeted by our hosts. Our guide Daniel, gave us a brief history of Sofia from it's origins to present day. We then proceeded to visit the highlights of the capital over approximately 2.5 hours. the major historic sights were highlighted and explained in the context of the history of the period. We were able to ask questions for the whole tour and all were answered happily and eloquently. The locations were also explained in the context of the history and the language and the cultures and customs of the time. the tour guides you around the city, so that lat you can choose which locations you may want to visit for more information later. in addition other sites are also indicated. the knowledge of Daniel, our guide was vast and he made the tour very enjoyable. Of all of the city tours I have done, this is by far the best to date and I would recommend to other travellers to get a good bearing for the city of Sofia. Thanks Daniel and team for a wonderful tour! ;28.07.2014;United Kingdom
424;Nicola M;"My partner and I went on the 2 hour bike tour with Lucy who was very knowledgable and gave us a great tour around Sofia. This is a fantastic introduction to Sofia and the guides are happy to help you out with any other questions such as recommendations for dinner, or other places to visit in Bulgaria.
The next day we completed the hiking tour in Sofia. We caught a cab which our guide organised (9 leva for one way trip) and began our walk up the mountain. It is a steep climb and you do need to have a good level of fitness to complete this-it is quite steep and rocky so good footwear is essential. Our guide was helpful and friendly and the Boyana waterfall at the top was stunning. After our descent down we visited the Boyana church which was great-you do feel very tired after the trek but the church is worth it (and free after 3pm on a Monday, otherwise 2 leva entrance fee). Overall, all guides were passionate and knowledgable about their city and their was no pressure for tipping-however they do such a good job and are giving up their time this is essential to do. I recommend both of these tours as they gave my partner and I a great feel for Sofia and we really enjoyed them both. ";28.07.2014;United Kingdom

426;brwatne;"The tour lasts for around 2.5hrs and our guide Dessi was really good in explaining us lots of history and background of Sofia from 6000 years back up until now. Some really cool ""hidden"" gems were also shown us (under ground!). Well worth it and definitely one of the better walking tours I've been on. Two thumbs up. :-) ";29.07.2014;Oslo
427;Katsumasa T;The tour I took was very informative and enjoyable. The tour guide, Dessi (if I don't misspell it), covers major sights in the city center and touches on related historical, political, and social issues from the Roman time till present (e.g., the history of Cyrillic alphabet, the protection of Jews in Bulgaria during the WWII, and the current state of the Bulgarian politics). Thanks to her efforts (and also her talent I believe), I undestood and learned a lot during the 2.5-hour walk. In some parts of the tour, she makes it entertaining probably for young participants. She is an excellent storyteller as well as a friendly person. In a bigger context, this tour is a good example for an effective bottom-up approach to promoting a tourism in a place where it is not much promoted from above. ;30.07.2014;Germany
428;Lundy1982;"Took the evening tour on our first day in Sofia and loved it. We had a bit of trouble finding the meeting point (and were thus slightly late), but the guide was very welcoming! She gave us a great introduction to the city and its history- pointing out places that we may not otherwise have noticed. Our guide spoke great english, and was happy to answer all our questions (as well as take a few photos).

The tour is free- but worth a tip at the end.

I'd recommend this tour for anyone looking to get their bearings in Sofia- it's a great introduction. ";30.07.2014;Australia
429;Gradu86;We just attended the free Sofia tour with Martin. I think this is the best way to start your visit to Sofia since he will show you the best landmark. The tour is free but we wanted to show them our appreciation and we tip 10 euro for 4 persons. ;02.08.2014;Romania
430;AsilvaC;"The tour takes you to the main monuments/attractions in the city center with very enthusiastic guides. You get good explanations and historical facts from the places you visit.
I went on a Saturday morning, there were a lot of people and the guides were well prepared. We were divided in 3 groups of around 20 people. The tour ends at the University after a bit more of two hours walking.
A very good way to get to know Sofia ";02.08.2014;Bulgaria

We asked if we can join the team and the adventure started!
Our guide was Ana.
The trip was very intense - we saw many monuments, landmarks and other historical buildings. Ana told us many things and answered questions that we asked.
There were also few contest for trip attendants so You could win something :D
Very nice time, beautiful city with many interesting places to visit.

If you are here for the first time - just join the team! Guide will do the rest for you ;-) ";04.08.2014;
432;Tanya K;"This was the absolute best experience I've ever had on a city tour! The tour guide was not only knowledgable but made history fun! She (I wish I remembered her name) was very enthusiastic and ensured all of us are having a great time while sightseeing and learning about the historic sites and events. She was encouraging questions and discussions, plus, she came up with fun games that made the experience even better!

The tour covers the main attractions of Sofia and is very well organized! On top of all of that... It's free!!! I've paid a lot of money for tours that weren't even half as good as this one!

Thank you, ""Free Sofia Tour"", for the wonderful experience! ";04.08.2014;Chicago
433;Mariana P;"For sure this is the best way to have an overview of the city, and its history! And after doing that you can come back to the places you liked the most and visit it and know discover more about it by yourself :)

Don't miss it!!! Include it in your Sofia schedule :) ";06.08.2014;
434;Richard10024;"I have now done over 8 free tours in Europe. I highly recommend them in concept. The guides tend to be better and more enthusiatic than guides on higher cost paid trips. Plus the tours have a lot of walking which I prefer to sitting on a bus. Plus there is a higher level of energy in general.

While there was some of all of that on the Free Sofia Tour, I would say it wasn't as good as free tours in Prague, Krakow and Budapest which I thought were a level above this tour. However, this still was an excellent few hours and I would recommend it as a good way to get an overview history and guide to Sofia. ";06.08.2014;New York City
435;HPatz;We did the Free Sofia Tour today and it was excellent. The tour is well paced and our guide Fillip was extremely knowledgable and presented the information in an interesting and fun way.

Chris (Le Male) was our guide for two to three hours. Took us to the most interesting of places and gave out lots of info. Very interesting, very informative. Good pace, not tiring. Lots of walking. Mostly young people in their 20's but I did not feel out of place. My teenage daughter enjoyed it too. Some facts given are not found in guide books. Highly recommended. Will do it again in Sofia and in other cities or countries. ;08.08.2014;Malta

The guide I had, Niki, was extremely well informed about all the sites and the history of the country, and was a friendly, engaging, and amicable guide. This is also a great place to meet other tourists from other countries!

The tour is aprox 2 hours and for free (you can tip afterwards if you want). Dima, our guide, was really sympathic and knew everything about the city and it's history. They distribute a voucher booklet after the tour with further ideas how to explore Sofia. We joined the pub crawl, which was much fun too. ;24.08.2014;Spain

451;GeekOnWheels;"This tour takes around 2 hours and you will see the main building and historic sites in the city centre. My tour was led by Viki who was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic. There are some roman remains in obscure places underneath roads that would take a long time to find on your own.

I recommend this tour if you're on a short trip, or at the start of a longer one to get your bearings.

There were a mixture of people on the tour from couples and families to solo travellers. After the tour, Viki led a group of us to a recommended restaurant where a few of us stayed for food and drink (but unfurtunately not Viki). Sadly I didn't get the name of the restaurant.

They do invite donations at the end, but there was no pressure to donate. ";31.08.2014;United Kingdom

456;Dragana S;This is a reeeeally great tour- I'm surprised how one can have so much energy after repeating the story over and over again. Our guide was Niki and the thing I liked the most was when he organised role-playing. Overall, don't miss this if you're in Sofia. ;08.09.2014;Serbia
457;Svetoslav_79;We were a group of 25. Our guide was Alya. She was very charismatic narrator with fluent English. In the tour there were urban legends, interesting historical facts and funny stories. I fully enjoyed it. ;08.09.2014;Bulgaria
458;Oybek S;I really liked it as the our tour guide (Dino) was very enthusiastic and energetic. Must do tour as the best way to get introduced to the city's main attractions.

459;EimileMcS;The guides on this walking tour were full of energy and they're passion for the city shown through. The way the history of the sites was told made it very interesting and not drag.

461;Roy C;All of the tour guides are very good but if you get the chance do go on Dima's tour! I have been coming to Sofia for a number of years, but had never been on a tour. Silly me! TAKE PART!! You will get to see many of the major attractions and sights that are within a short walking distance of the Courthouse. Even if you already know some Bulgarian history you are bound to learn some new things, and if you can answer a guide's question then you'll get a Tutti Frutti sweeti as a reward. (Question Hint: Don't be late for your tour, they're a prompt lot these Bulgarians.) Dima was very knowledgeable, took good care of the group, and made sure everyone was just fine both during and at the end of the tour. Lot's of energy made for a fun time! ;11.09.2014;United Kingdom
462; LorenzoStella_68;The students giving the tour are great. Very enthusiastic and proud of their Country. It's like having a Bulgarian friend guiding you through the city and explaining its history. The group in my case was larger than what I had hoped (about 50 people) but our guide managed it perfectly. You will not enter any buildings, museums or churches, but if you do the tour on the first day, you can have a great overview and decide what to visit during the rest of your stay. I even had a great indication for an excellent local restaurant (Lubimoto) from our guide ;12.09.2014;Italy

It will give you a lot of interesting information about Sofia and Bulgaria. You will enter any buildings like churches or museums, but you will be get a lot of hints what to visit in the next days. That's why it is important to take this tour on one of the first days of your trip.

And our host Slavian was really great. ";18.09.2014;Poland
465;Sarah M;A fantastic way to see the sights of Sofia in a short space of time. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and engaging, and made the history of Bulgaria and Sofia come alive. It is a great way to orientate yourself in the city, and find out where the highlights are, and then you can go back later to revisit the things you're interested in when you have more time. As Sofia is a fairly compact city, there isn't too far to walk between stops. We enjoyed it so much that we went on to do the Free Plovdiv Tour (also excellent) and plan to do the same in Varna. Thanks very much guys! ;19.09.2014;
466;Zoe L;Our guide was Kristina and she was amazing! We had no trouble hearing her throughout and she had sweets to give out! It was a great introduction to the city and made a short stay seem a lot more informative! Highly recommend! ;20.09.2014;Auckland

468;Mattia T;Really great: fun and entertaining! Definitevly worth it... I took it twice, the guides were very nice and full of energy. Even if I had already explored the city I discovered many new things with the free Sofia Tour ;22.09.2014;Italy
469;Sally A;The Sofia free walking tour was the ideal length and was jam packed with sites and interesting stories provided by our tour guide, Dino. He had a fantastic attitude and his passion for the city came across so well that we couldn't help falling in love with the city ourselves! Definitely do this tour it is a great introduction to the wonderful Sofia. ;23.09.2014;United Kingdom
470;charlb82;Definitely recommend these tours. Our tour guide Slavyan took us around the city's major attractions explaining some history and sociology-political scenarios on the way. Guide was very friendly, helpful and well-informed. Kept the tour up-beat. ;25.09.2014;Malta
471;Diogo G;U get to see the main attractions of the center of Sofia with an explanation of its cultural history! A must do :) ;26.09.2014;
472;Fabio_fln;During our month's vacation we did about 4 walking tours in many cities and this was by far the one I liked the most. The guide was extremely enthusiastic and really knew how to show the city and its landmarks. ;30.09.2014;Brazil
473;Juliana F;"The tour is a great way to have a glimpse of all that Sofia has to offer, being a city with such a long history and so many interesting cultural things and sights.

Try to get it in the first day(s) of your stay in Sofia, and you can also take advantage of the tour to begin to get familiar with the place. If you have more time, go more than once, as each guide have their own insights on what they show to us. (: ";01.10.2014;
474; Bludesch;"

was completely suprised about the excellent guiding. All questions answered, very interesting performance, lots of information. Didn't expect to much about Sofia and the tour itself and was wrong. Both, city and ""Sofia on tour"" were excellent. And - don't forget to tipp at the end!
";01.10.2014;Austria
475;Joe C;Really recommend doing this. You get to see a lot of Sofia in a short space of time. Plus get told stories behind the city and get your questions answered. The person leading the tour was good, making it fun and entertaining even though the weather wasn't. ;02.10.2014;
476;Quaffley;Went on the 11am tour, which was good. We were quite a large group, around 50 people, and only had one guide which made asking questions/moving around kind of difficult. A friend said he had done the tour a month earlier and they had split a group of 60 into 2 which would have been nicer, but I think we went during tourist off season so they had fewer guides available. It's a great tour to see the outside of most touristy places, and make note of where you'd like to come back to explore in more detail. Definitely one of the better free walking tours I've been on in Europe, but I could have been more engaged had the group been more manageable.;05.10.2014;
477;janette190;Great tour guides and very interesting historical facts . The best way to learn about this lovely city ;06.10.2014;United Kingdom

479;linatre11;Tours start daily at 11 am and 6 pm in front of the Department of Justice building citty corner across from McDonalds. We had a great guide Dino (actor by night) who had a great delivery, a great sense of humor and passionate enthusiasm for Bulgarian history and his city. The tour covers the main highlights of the city. It move along at a good pace. Dino was open to answering questions and did not rush anyone. One of the best walking tours we have ever taken anywhere. The tour is free but how can you not tip someone who does such a great job! ;06.10.2014;Florida

the time flew by very quickly, we enjoyed it very much.

highly recommended ";07.10.2014;Greece
482;rtareva;Funny, entertaining, knowledgeable, elaborate... You cannot ask for more from a free tour. I have been to many free tours around Europe and this one shines. I took my foreign friends (who were staying with me while in Sofia) to the Free Sofia Tour and I was so nicely surprised to go on one of the best tours back home:) ;08.10.2014;Bulgaria
483;         Send a message      Never_Easy_to_Please;This tour is well worth taking. The guides are excellent and the sights are fascinating. You'll spend 2.5 hours listening to interesting stories, seeing the main attractions in the center of the city. I'd encourage you to do the tour upon arrival and use it to decide what you want to do with the remainder of your time in Sofia. The guides are friendly and knowledgeable and are happy to answer your questions about navigating the city, etc. ;08.10.2014;
484;Victor P;The walking tour was great: the guide was very knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic. I think that the tour would be pleasant for both those that have deep passion for history as well as visitors simply driven by curiosity. Interesting stories, landmarks that I may have otherwise missed, great atmosphere. Highly enjoyable. You also get candies if you answer some questions :) ;10.10.2014;Sweden
485;Vivienne H;It was a brilliant tour. The guide was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. There was so much information interestingly told. I definitely recommend it ;10.10.2014;
486;Nanook780;"This isn't an all inclusive tour. It's a tour that gives the history of a few sites (from the outside). It gives you some tips of the town and some cute little anecdotes.
My husband and I like to walk around a city or take public transportation. This tour helped us to fgure the city out a little ____where things are in relation to one another. We also went back to see the sites from the inside that were shown on the tour.
If you're over 50, wear your sneakers___you can do it! It's well worth your time ";11.10.2014;New York City
487;Maksym M;"Great tour. Our guide Martin made amazing walking around the center if Sofia. An attitude he uses for talking story is really fun. He doesn't overload people with scientific history, instead of it he arranges theater's performance. Take a few people from the visitors and resign them historical character, like kings. After that a history of Bulgaria learns very easy. Also he arranges some quizzes with the questions like: ""what is the purpose of this building?"" And gives candy for whom answered correctly. So it was amazing and I definitely suggest you to take part in it =) ";12.10.2014;Ukraine
488;aha3f;It was a great walking tour that took us all over downtown Sofia and to all the major sites. When I lived in Bulgaria years ago, I would see these places and I knew a little bit about each one but our guide was able to really dig into the history of these spots and how it all falls into the overreaching history of the country. Entertaining, informative, and yes, there was some interactive role playing on the part of the walkers to learn the history of the modern rulers. A great way to see and learn about the main historical sites in the city. Highly recommend. ;13.10.2014;Washington
489;Plamen D;Visiting the Free Sofia Tour was a great pleasure and a really interesting way to learn a lot more things than expected about my own home town. The guide, Vasko, was absolutely knowledgeable, answered all the questions of the visitors and at the end directed a really funny role play performance to show us the Bulgarian history of the past century. If you are local it is a great way to learn many facts about Sofia and Bulgaria you probably didn't know, and if you are foreign visitor, the whole tour will keep you busy listening to so many interesting stories without overshooting you with redundant historical facts.. I strongly recommend the tour to anyone visiting Sofia as it is probably the best way to explore the city. ;14.10.2014;Bulgaria
490;Iftach N;An excellent tour - friendly, a good but easy walk, met nice people on the way and Niki the guide was great ! Its really free and they don't push business or commercial agendas - they mention briefly in the beginning that you're welcome to tip or donate to the organization.;15.10.2014;Romania
491;GingerRoad;Our guide was great and got around and spoke to almost everyone in our very large group. Gave us a well informed tour of the city and a brief history of the country. Sofia is a popular stop on the way to Istanbul so this is a very good condensed tour for those flying through (even though Bulgaria is amazing and you should definitely stay for longer than you planned!) Well worth it. ;15.10.2014;
492;Inkblot_doc;"This young man provides you with before and after pictures; gives you an entertaining history lesson and uses the tour guest to demonstrate the once royal linage in Bulgaria. You really are able to get a feel of the city. In English. Our walk had people form South Africa, Australia, Austria, Israel, Latvia, Germany and Russia. It is a lot of fun and well paced. ";16.10.2014;South Carolina
493;Sumcurlyfries;"This was by FAR the best tour I've ever had. My guide was Dino and he was fun, educational, and captivating.
Bulgaria has a long and controversial history. My guide Dino had the tough task of giving controversial facts to a mixed group of Pro-Soviet women, anti-Soviet youth, sensitive Arabs, Jews, etc. Yet he did so marvelously.
Do NOT leave Sophia without taking this tour. And for heaven's sake TIP THE MAN! Half of my group snuck off after the tour like they left their wallet in the car! ";17.10.2014;Saudi Arabia
494;Poppy C;It was an experience going around Sofia with free Sofia tour! If you are in the city, make sure you don't miss that! Also, special thanks to Slavian, our guide. Excellent!!!! ;17.10.2014;Turkey
495;BazLoz;"These tours in general are a must in any city that has them, and this one in particular was another excellent one, taking around the perfect two hours.

Our guide was Vasil, who was great (but they all seem to be). They don't just deliver a scripted tour; they can seemingly fully answer any range of diverse (and sometimes irrelevant) questions, and Vasil himself was thoroughly knowledgeable and enthusiastic, peppering facts with amusing and interesting anecdotes, and all in perfect full flowing English.

Let's be clear: you MUST TIP these people. OK, ""free"" is a bit of a misnomer, but they make it perfectly clear at the beginning how it works (as if it wasn't obvious anyway). I was disappointed to note comments in a previous review about people peeling away without paying - shame on you! Even a student backpacker should find something, but for us other tourists, there's simply no excuse. ";20.10.2014;United Kingdom

497;Sam3314;"I would recommend this as your first activity in Sofia. It gives you a chance to learn about the history of the city and identify places to visit. The guides are all local and willing to help with advice on what to do with your time in the city and Bulgaria. Our guide Dessi was excellent and mixed up the facts with role-playing (volunteers) and spot prizes.
Tour runs twice a day and is easy walking. ";23.10.2014;Australia
498;Yairrr;Simply great! Takes place always- even if it snows. Educational in a fun way. The instructors are students/graduates and the pace is good. ;25.10.2014;Israel

500;Julien K;A great way to discover the city centre of Sofia and its history, as well as to meet other people when you travel alone. Our guide was really nice. I also recommend the Sofia Green Tour (haven't tried the bike tour). ;27.10.2014;Belgium
501;Ian486;For a day spent passing through Sofia this was a perfect introduction to the city. An entertaining and knowledgeable guide with great communication skills ensured an enjoyable time was had by the diverse group of people on the tour. ;27.10.2014;United Kingdom
502;Kathy H;We did the tour, guided by Kristina, friendly and nice girl. The tour was good, learnt a lot about the Bulgarian capital, it's history, main sights and so on. Beautiful place with rich history, presented by young and knowledgeable people. Highly recommended! ;28.10.2014;Australia
503;AudaciousAmbulator;Our guide, Chris, knew so much about the city and its antecedents! He integrated the pre-Roman, Roman, Ottoman, medieval and Russian eras, along with Bulgaria today. I hope I'm not making it sound boring, because it was light-hearted, fun and fascinating. My son-in-law, a Roman archaeologist, found it all accurate but at an approachable level for the rest of us. We supported this nonprofit organization at the end of the tour, ad plan to use it two days from now when we go to our next Bulgarian city, Plovdiv, on Friday. ;29.10.2014;Bulgaria
504;M P;It was very popular when we went on it in mid-October, with around 15 people from around the world, and it lasted a good two hours, until 8pm. We saw all aspects of the city’s fascinating historical past: from the Byzantine, Roman, Ottoman, to the Communist era. Our guide, the incredibly smart, confident, and vivacious Victoria, is so passionate about what she does and an absolute fountain of knowledge! With her we discovered the latest underground archaeological discoveries, symbols hidden in walls, and some magical thermal springs! It was great and this on-hand, face to face experience made us understand a lot more about the city than you can get from a documentary or guidebook. ;29.10.2014;
505;VyaraZ;Very enjoyable experience. Highly recommend it! The guide, Kristina, was very friendly and cheerful girl. Even though, I am originally from Bulgaria, I didn't know many of the things she shared with us, and thus, I was very satisfied with the experience. At some point of the tour, she also came up with a short game in order to make the history more fun. ;30.10.2014;United Kingdom
506;illini2000_LA;We are so happy we took this tour. Our guide, Niki, was really great and easy to understand. He also seemed to really enjoy meeting people and giving the tour. We recommend doing this when you're in Sofia. It doesn't take that much time and its an easy walk. ;30.10.2014;California
507;Andy L;"I really enjoyed two hours with the Free Sofia Tour. What a great way to see Sofia and learn the background and history behind the major landmarks.

Martin, our guide was very knowledgable and great fun. He made a clear effort to talk individually to everyone on the tour and make sure no one felt on the fringes. He also gave a few of us a great recommendation for a place to go on to eat afterwards.

Wrap up warm though! ";01.11.2014;United Kingdom
508;2jerome;"Or sixteen, or fourteen major sights you will pass by on this free walking tour. Of course no visits, that would take a couple of days.
They start at 11 am, at the palace of justice: rain or snow or sunshine,, it does not matter.
It is full of fun and joy, questions are asked and a correct answer gets a candy!
Lots of fun at the mineral springs, where somebody asked if the water is bottled and sold by the supermarket for a dollar. A local citizen was upset and hurried to explain that, according to the Holy Bible, water is always for free...
A play at the end of the tour! And a picture of the group to be put on their facebook wall....
Don't underestimate more than 2 hours walking, it is tiring indeed.
Don't go on Sunday, too many walkers. And do give a tip; the money is used for further development of the project.
Thank you Nora, for guiding us! ";01.11.2014;Belgium

514;RobandChris2014;Even though I have lived in Sofia for over a year, I just recently took the Free Sofia Tour when we had a friend visiting and I found it to be very interesting. I learned many interesting facts about the city and saw some sites I di not even know about. Our guide spoke excellent English and he had a very good sense of humor as he told us about particular aspects of Bulgarian culture and history. Even though the tour is 2 hours long, the time goes by quickly and you can leave early if you want. Highly recommended for visitors in the downtown area as it is a great area to walk around. ;04.11.2014;Bulgaria
515;Rebecca B;The Free Sofia Tour is absolutely the BEST free thing to do in Sofia! The tour happens rain or shine, and you don't need to make a reservation - just show up. If you're coming with a larger group (10 or more), they do ask that you send a message so they can ensure that there will be enough guides. I've taken the tour three times and have learned new things each time. The guides are all very energetic and don't mind the endless questions people in the group ask. It's a great way to see the city, learn some history, and get orientated to the central area of the city. The guides also give helpful recommendations on other places to visit, restaurants to try, and activities happening in the city. Highly recommended! ;04.11.2014;
516;Sofie K;"The guides where energetic and positive. You never stopped listening since she was so captivating in her stories. We went to around 8-10 places in a near-by area (took 2 hours) and she told us some stories about the places that we would have never known without this tour. Simply amazing! It costs
 nothing, but they appreciate a gift to their future work. ";04.11.2014;Sweden
517;Nikolay M;"It is worth to do a free guided tour in Sofia. I did it myself just to see the quality and can positively say that the guys who do it are already specialists :) They guide you through the ancients remains of Sofia as well as between the modern look and the bonus is that you always can ask them and receive quality answer

521; Serhat T;"I really like this Free Tour stuff. I really enjoyed the one in Copenhagen 2 months ago, and of course the last one 16.11.2014 in Sofia.
Daniel is a very friendly and smart guide and accompanied and entertained us for 2.5 hours tour in a cold Sofia day.
Nothing much to see in Sofia, compared to other European capitals, however without this tour, you would be passing by a statue or a historical place, without knowing the history.
I recommend for those who think they will be bored in Sofia.
Although it is a free tour, you are expected to give a few Levs for the guide's effort.
You must not runaway at the end of the tour like the Erasmus kids.
Just a few Euros will not make you poorer! Please respect the service.

522;Aaron B;"I've done a few walking tours now and this one is one of the best that I've attended.. It's rather professional, quirky and interesting. I found that the demographic varied a fair bit which was nice to see, generally it's people in their 20's but it was good seeing older people get out and checking it out too.

Really good value people! ";18.11.2014;
523;Sean M;"If you are travelling to Sofia and think that the place is a bit of a shell rather than substance, then you can't go past the free Sofia tour.

The tour guides are fluent in English and full of interesting facts about the area. With around 6,000 years of history from before the Thracians (Hercules times), to the Romans, the Byzantines, Ottomans and Russians, it really is a lot to take in. I am a bit of a fan of history anyway, but this tour really filled in a lot of gaps about Bulgaria and its people.

Don't do yourself a disservice, jump onto the next tour as I am sure you will glad you did so.....

544;towstt;By best tour I mean including those I've paid for in all my experience. The guy was funny, polite, clear, artistic, spoke very good English. The best and most funny part was where he volunteered the audience to participate. You definetily have to try it.;06.01.2015;Israel
545;Barry416;It's Free...a great historical overview and key sights in the city centre. Be prepared for a couple hours of information with short spurts of walking. Anna answered all questions and made the tour a lot of fun. Couldn't have asked for anything more! ;15.01.2015;
546;Ilovefrenchpolynesia;I highly recommend doing this free tour. They walk you through the city showing the main attractions without actually going in to inside the places. If you have one day to see the city, it's a great way to explore Sofia.;16.01.2015;海外

I have sent foreign friends to this tour, but when my husband and me finally went ourselves I understood truly what everyone was talking about. 2 hours spent in another time and place while walking in the streets of our well known city.

Thanks again Niki, couldn´t ask for a better guide! ^_^";08.02.2015;Bulgaria

558;RebeccaRubia;I'd been living in Sofia for a year when I decided to take the tour and I loved it! I learned so much about the history of the buildings which I'd seen many times before but had no idea about! I also found it was a great way to find my way around the city on foot as previously I was only going by car to the city centre. The tour guide was great, he gave us lots of local knowledge and made everything interesting and fun. I highly recommend the tour! ;08.02.2015;Bulgaria

560;Wiltshire G;"I was in Sofia recently and went on the Free Sofia tour, a two-hour walking tour around the key central sights. While it covers lot of ground, the walking involved is probably managable for most people.

The tour covered all the key places you would want to see, and our guide Dino provided information on history, architecture and society.

This was a great attraction that I would recommend to others. ";11.02.2015;United Kingdom
561;Tamaris84;Very detailed and very interesting! The guide (Hi Kris!) was very entertaining and knowledgeable and the tour itself covers the most important sites in Sofia. It's best you the morning tour and have the afternoon to go back to the sites of your choice. ;12.02.2015;Belgrade

563;Di C;"At the beginning of February I found myself in Sofia for a couple of days on business. As this was my first time in Bulgaria, I started researching how to best utilize my time after work to explore this wonderful city!
I found Free Sofia Tours and at 6pm on our first night there, a colleague and myself found ourselves being led all around the city by one of the guides Kristina! Kristina was an absolute dream of a tour guide; not only did she have extensive knowledge about the history and cultural backgrounds of every place she took us too, she was happy to answer any questions we had, and even handed out Bulgarian sweets as prizes for impromptu quizzes! We had a great time walking around Sofia and by the end of the 2 hours I felt as though I had a much more comprehensive understanding of the city which was great to draw on for the rest of my time there.
So a big THANK YOU to Kristina for being an amazing guide, and THANK YOU to Free Sofia Tours for providing such a great service!! ";17.02.2015;United Kingdom

We joined the 11am tour on Sunday and we had Alex as our guide. She was fun and tried to involve everyone when telling us the history/stories of the city. The pace of the tour was adequate and no rushing around (plenty of time for photo-taking). At the end she answered many questions like where to have lunch, how to get to places etc...
We are glad that we followed this tour because we missed a few things on the first day and Alex did a fantastic job giving us the background of the places we saw! ";18.02.2015;Italy

It's good for meeting other like minded people too.;16.03.2015;UK

581;filipecmatos;This tour must be the first thing you while in Sofia! This will give you an overview about the city and its history in a really entertaining and funny way.

After this tour you'll be more prepared to visit all the buildings and monuments in Sofia.;18.03.2015;Portugal

600;R-Tekke;"I actually live here since a bit over 6 months, but Kristina Arnoudova gave me a lot of information that I had no idea of. The weather was horrible, but I have had a great day. I don't speak more than twenty words of Bulgarian, but I do get the idea that I am part of this beautiful country. I never wanted to come here, but by now I don't feel the slightest need to go anywhere else. Actually making money is still possible in this country (not entirely unimportant). The city is older than Rome and Athens and Bulgarians are beautiful people that aren't touched by modern Western decadence. I have lived in Italy for many tears, but: Serdica mea Roma est.

601;Isurehopeso;I took the tour on my first full day in Sofia and it was a very smart decision. Kris led our tour and he was informative, entertaining and very approachable and friendly. He was the ideal host and had just the right amount of enthusiasm too. I highly recommend the Sofia Free Walking Tour. The only suggestion I'd make is for the company to put the address of the meeting point on their website instead of just saying that the group meets at the Palace of Justice. This would save would-be participants one step in googling the address but this is obviously a minor point. Excellent tour!!;09.04.2015;Canada

604;Waiyu C;A great way to see most of the city, especially when you don't have much time. It's also very convenient that they have two tours a day. Though it rained and was quite cold that day but the guide made the most of his efforts to keep the atmosphere up!;13.04.2015;South Korea

609;Carol E;"I was staying in downtown Sofia over a weekend while working in the area. My colleague recommended the tour as it was in English and was FREE!! We walked to the starting point from our hotel. It's easy to spot the tour group near the big Lions at the Justice building. The guides are wearing jackets and holding signs. The tour takes place every day at 11 am and 6 pm. I took the 11 am tour. We left about 11:10 and we were finished by 1 pm. 

Dino was our tour guide and he was very entertaining and answered any questions that we had. At each location he had a story for us and even some jokes. We saw all of the major churches and a few other famous statues and buildings. You don't go in any of them but it's easy to go back to the spots after the tour is over and spend more time at or in them. 

He also taught us a bit of the history of Communism in Bulgaria and I found that part very interesting. 

When the tour is over, you can give him a tip/donation and it was well worth it.";17.04.2015;USA

611;Canada4649;My husband and I enjoyed this walking tour on April 10 and it was the highlight of our three day visit to Sofia. Vasko, our guide, was such an enthusiastic and knowledgeable ambassador for his city that the time passed all too quickly. We came away with a great appreciation for Bulgaria's history and Sofia's charms. Although, we were part of a large group, Vasko took time to answer any questions and engineered a brief historical drama incorporating audience participation. We highly recommend this tour. If possible make the tour your introduction to the city and then you can visit the interiors of the churches, museums, etc which are of interest to you later. Thank-you, Vasko, for a great tour.;18.04.2015;Canada
612;1missvee;My friend and I visited Sofia for a few days, we joined as a group for a free Sofia walking tour on the 24th April 2015, we met @The Palace of Justice which was only 2minutes away from our hotel. First for the Cultural tour @11am which lasted for about 3hrs. The tour guide was Deni, she spoke very good English, she took us to various places and introduced us to typical Bulgarian folk music, she showed us a basic folk dance and tasted Bulgarian food and drink. It was a great introduction to Sofia. The tour was so enjoyable, we join another one @4pm for the historical tour with Dino. He also spoke very good English, the tour lasted about 2hrs. In one day we were packed with knowledge of the history and cultural of Bulgaria. If we had stayed a bit longer we'll definately join another tour that they offered 'Communist Tour'. Well. This was my first visit to Bulgaria and definately not the last. We highly recommend Sofia free Walking Tour.;19.04.2015;UK
613;criirsara;"I enjoyed the free Sofia tour a lot, the guide, Anni, was very entertaining and enthusiastic, and was able to give a good vibe to the whole group.

614;Sandra T;This was a free walking tour of Sofia. It was about 1 1/2 hours long and it was very informative. You walk around the city and the guide talks about the different buildings and happenings of Sofia.;20.04.2015;USA
615;KJonD;"I am a long-time foreign resident of Sofia, so not your typical candidate for a tour. I had a guest coming into to town for one day and the tour was recommended to us by a friend. It was a good suggestion.

The tour starts from convenient location in the center and lasts for roughly two hours. It winds through the streets and past most of the key places of interest downtown. Our guide, Radina, was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and enjoyable to be around. She interacted a lot with the group, which in my case included people from all over the globe. 

The great thing about the tour is that it provides a quick foundation of the major sites and their location. Those with time can go back, enter buildings they are interested in and linger. Others can move on. Either way, the tour provides a foundation so you feel like you have a sense of the city and its history. 

I think the tour could improve by pointing out some additional attractions. For example, when we visited Alexander Nevsky square, it would have been good to point out that there is a very good icon museum in the basement at Nevksy, and the newly opened crypts below Saint Sofia are a must see. 

While I think that there could be some minor tweaks to improve the tour, overall, I think it is great way to learn about Sofia quickly in a fun, group setting. 

The tour is provided free of charge. However, be nice and tip your guide if you think they did a good job.";20.04.2015;Bulgaria

630;Julie C;"I took two tours...the free history tour and a new tour focused on culture. Both were very good. The tour size was large (25) so it was difficult to hear the guides at times. Guides were friendly and knowledgeable and encouraged questions.
They need to watch the length of their tours. I was told the culture tour would be about 3 hers and it was over 4 hours. The history tour was advertised as 1.5 hours but ran 2.15 hours. Maybe it was due to the large group size. Otherwise this was a great way to spend an afternoon in Sofa.";05.05.2015;USA
631;Evelyn B;"If you want to learn more about Sofia and bulgarian history, represented in a really interesting way - you got to the right! Passionate historians, people, who are experts in their field of study gave me the opportunity to see the city that I live in a whole new way. They showed me things that I pass by every day on my way to job, but never even notice. Definately the best way to learn more about Sofia is the Free Sofia tour. Great job guys! 
I also highly recommend The communist tour - it's a little bit longer (about 3 hours), but definately worth it!";06.05.2015;
632;chessiegirl;We had a tour with Deni. Lots of people had turned up and the group was split into two. We went with her and must have been about 30 in each group. Her English is superb and I think everyone was able to hear her all the time. She was funny, knowledgeable and paced the tour well. We saw most of the main sites - as the city is quite small they are fairly close together. Remember to wear flat shoes as the pavements are very uneven. At the end there was no pressure to tip, we did as it was something we would have paid a lot to do in other cities. Really enjoyed it and recommend it as a way to understand the history of the country and the city.;06.05.2015;UK
633;Myathe;"Very nice tour, we got one with Deni. She was nice and knowledgeable and entertaining as well. Lots of nice stories. I highly recommend it. Also a good sign was when we came to the meeting point, it was so many people, like 60- 80. And we got 3 guides for free walking tour and 1 guide for cultural tour, so we got divided into 4 groups. Each group was not more than 20, which was perfect.

641;FusionOfHorizons;"I took the free sofia tour and the culture tour. Both were interesting in their own way. But what makes it more interesting for me is the passion the guides put into telling their stories. The free sofia tour seems more finetuned than the culture tour. However, although the culture tour needs some work to make it more cohesive. I find this tour a lot more fun due to the interactive element.
Keep up the good work!

I had no idea the city contained so much history. The tour was structured well and organized logically. Though it was Simone's third tour, she did a great job and I was very happy she was my guide.

650;JACKSONS-NORTHERNGOA;My hubby and I have just moved to Bulgaria to live and thought it was important we leRn about the countries history. We could not have chosen a better way to do so! You start the tour at the Palace of Justice at 11am or 6pm ( the building with 2 huge lions in front ) and as we were a large group as per an earlier review we were split into 2 small groups. Our guide Nikki was fantastic and explained everything in a way that kept us interested for the full 2 hrs 30 mins. The walking is at a steady pace not needing a lot of exertion and you get to appreciate the beautiful buildings you may otherwise miss. As the main buildings and monuments are in a reasonably compact Area it's easy to get your bearings for a visit back to any of them on your own for a longer viewing. We are looking forward to the Communisim walk tomorrow.;25.05.2015;Bulgaria
651;bananafiend;This tour was excellent - it was a great introduction to the city and I learnt a lot as our guide Dessi was very knowledgeable and friendly. I would recommend that this is the first item on any visitor's itinerary - you don't actually go in to any of the attractions, but you can always go back later to explore them in more detail yourself after the tour has finished. The tour was at good pace and as the city centre is compact, there's not too much walking involved. Highly recommended!;25.05.2015;UK
652;R0bert93;"This year around Europe we did 4 free walking tours including this one (Amsterdam, Bruges, Brussels) and I must say that I was pretty impressed by the fact that Bulgaria's tour was the second best of all. The guide, Dino, was very funny and thrilled about his city. He gave us the opportunity to know a lot more about the city and its history. In my opinion it is the best way to discover some of a country's culture and to learn about it. This is why we did so many walking tours this year. I haven't done any paid tour because free is better then paid, but also because I think the energy behind a free tour is not the same as in a paid one.

Dino, our guide was making funny jokes while giving out information about Sofia. There's a reason the tour is no. 1 and I'll let you discover by yourself";26.05.2015;Canada

662;JaneWin123;"I am in Sofia to work for my company and so i dont have much time during the day to see Sofia. A colleague suggested the free walking tour, so I went on the 6pm tour today. The tour guide was Niki. He spoke very clear english and also was very clear on explaining the bulgarian language and translating between the two. He gave a great introduction to Bulgaria and was very knowledgable at each of the sights we visited. The tour ran til just after 8pm, but it didnt even seem like it had been 2 hours, as the information and the sights were very fascinating. The tour enabled me to see much more of the city and learn about the city in those 2 hours, than if i had have bought books and spent a couple of days just walking around etc. 
Niki was also very helpful with any questions that didnt relate specifically to the tour.
The tour is free, and tips are welcome, but at the end, Niki didnt even have to mention if anyone would like to give a tip as everyone already had money ready to give
The tour has made me want to see and do even more in Sofia, possibly even return for a short break :)";01.06.2015;
663;Rameshlcfc;"It is a great tour presented by nice group of people donating their free time. It is worth giving a donation to the guide. I was disappointed to see some of the people walked away as soon as the tour finished.

Next morning we joined the tour at 11am. The guide was full of information and our second visit to most of this sites made so much sense with running commentary.

668;Rumples;"This free 2-hour walking tour gave us a a wonderful overview of Sofia during our first day in the city. Our guide, Simona, proved to be professional, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. She worked at getting everyone in our 17-member group actively involved by asking questions along the way, such as what is the national animal of Bulgaria. (Lion) She gave a candy to the first person with the correct answer. After a young woman answered the first three questions correctly, Simona asked how she knew so much about Bulgaria. The response: ""I'm Bulgarian."" We all laughed and Simona, in a good natured manner, disqualified her from answering upcoming questions.

The tour focuses on Sofia's history and central area (cathedral, mosque, archaeological sites, court of justice, national theatre, etc.). It involves much walking as well as ascending and descending many steps. Participants can leave at any time. No reservation is required.Those interested simply show up at the designated time -- 11 a.m. for the morning walk or 6 p.m. for the evening departure -- in front of the court of justice.

Simona was impossible to miss at the meeting point. She held a large sign and watched for participants. A second guide stood with her to form another group if a large number showed up. More than 30 arrived for this evening walk, so we divided into two groups.

Though the tour is free, participants are invited at its beginning to give a donation at the end to the organization that operates the tours. There is absolutely no pressure to contribute. We happily did so at the conclusion of our tour.

The Free Sofia Tour runs twice daily, 365 days a year, regardless of weather. We found it to be a great investment of our travel time.";07.06.2015;USA

676;KnutFromMunich;"As I’ve announced to travel to Sofia most of my friends asked why I’m going to visit that city? Having seen most of the European capital cities, Sofia was one missing city in my travel portfolio. I’ve searched for a guidebook of Sofia but that’s really though. All in all Sofia is not a very touristic city. So I’ve searched in the Internet what to do and found that free sofia tour.

That was THE Highlight of our journey, retrospectively. Our tour guide was Anna. She is awesome, very smart and an entertaining girl. Keep in mind that the city has not the attractions like Rome, Berlin, London or Paris. Even in my hometown Munich with equal numbers of citiziens (1,4 million) there are much more famous attractions (host of olympic games 1972, BMW, Oktoberfest, city of beer, Hofbräuhaus, soccer club FC Bayern München, and much more....) So it becomes more substantial how you present your city. Anna did it with very much pleasure to her hometown. It was more like strolling with your friends through the city and have some joking fun. She also speaks very good, clear and fluent English. As I’ve a lot to do with native speakers in my business I didn’t notice any accent in her speech (maybe native speakers will). This is not self-evident in Sofia. Try to buy some French fries at the American fast food company with the golden M in Sofia and you will know what I mean.

Sofia is a city of contrasts. Have a look at the central station of Sofia (not part of the tour) which is the first impression for many visitors. Sorry- but it is that much scabby that it becomes some sort of attraction (June 2015). On the other hand you’ll find in the city pompous architecture of communism, historic sites (part of the tour) or modern west architecture. Many things seem since many years under construction and not coming to an end. Furthermore you have a huge differential in education. As Bulgaria is a poor country (just have a look at the GDP or average income) I could imagine that most higher educated people striving abroad to gain higher wages. All the better is that there are some young, driven, educated people in Sofia, loving their city and showing it with passion to the visitors in their free tours. Sofia is a city with potential and I can recommend that free tour absolutely! It is an attraction by itself.";11.06.2015;Germany
677;AndyTsoi;"I turned up at 5pm expecting only a few other tourists as it was late in the day. There was actually closer to 50 people waiting. Because of the large number of tourists it was necessary to bring in a second guide and split the groups causing a slight delay.
The guide for my group was Dino. He is a knowledgeable, charismatic, entertaining man with plenty of anecdotes and jokes to tell along the way. His spoken English was excellent.
Sofia isn’t a visually attractive city like Prague or Budapest, so it really needs a guide with a lot of knowledge of the history and culture of the city to keep you occupied and informed as you proceed along the tour.
I found the length of the tour and the pace just right.
I would recommend other Sofia visitors take this tour as the first excursion as it gives a good insight to some of the major attractions in the centre of the city, which you can then go back and visit at your leisure.";08.06.2015;UK

They were both exceptional guides with comprehensive knowledge and an infectious enthusiasm for their city, which was both endearing and informative. I make it a habit to take free walking tours wherever they are available, but I have never seen the level of creativity in any group to equal this one. This will make the city for you. Not to be missed.;01.07.2015;China
698;Angela J;It is a free walking tour starts daily at 11am and at 6pm. It is run by university students. It is offered in several languages and the guides are extremely knowledgeable in the history of the city. In just under 2 hours you can learn a great deal about the history. It is a nice leisurely walk through a beautiful city. A must especially if you don't have a lot of time.;02.07.2015;USA

700;Student_25_happy_;"We attended the walking tour guided by Ivan on 2nd of July at 11a.m. It was a sunny day and we made wonderful pictures, each of them related to an important event or story of Bulgaria/Sofia. 
I can only recommend the perfect oragnization and the smiling guide Ivan, also the whole walking tour- because within 2 h we heard the most interesting thing about the dontown and saw all the views (you usually find on the postcards with Sofia)! 
I found also very nice that everybody gave some tip at the end of the tour for the volunteer student who showed us Sofia!
Big YES!";03.07.2015;
701;marijansesvete;The guide was very interesting, but was trying to much to be that, so she laughed to much and unnatural, but that was sign of huge effort. Her english was perfect and number and attractivity of informations stunning. She prepared even a tea at the warm fountain. I reccomend that tours highly. Also slavic charming!;04.07.2015;Croatia

705;franksY9432TB;This tour leaves from the Palace of Justice (under the Lion)! The guide was most pleasant and well-informed and in spite of my hearing difficulty I had no problem with her commentary. Great to get an insight into the complicated history of Sofia and Bulgaria as reflected in its beautiful buildings and archaeological sites. A must for any visitor to Sofia!;08.07.2015;UK
706;Katie_and_Nick;We took advantage of many free walking tours in various cities during our Romania/ Bulgaria trip, and this was one of the best. We went in the morning and there was a large crowd, but there were several tour guides so they split us up into smaller groups. Our guide was very thorough and informative with a nice sense of humor. She led us all over the city to visit the main sites and provide us with insight to the city, country, and sites. The tour lasted about 2 - 2 1/2 hours.;07.07.2015;USA

It's a pleasant two hour walking tour which enables you to get to know the major sites of Sofia.The tour is free and if you feel like it
at the end you give a small donation.";11.07.2015;Israel
712;CruiseOneSF;"I was a bit reluctant to take a free tour, is anything really free? The TripAdvisor reviews changed my mind and what did I have to lose? I decided to go to the evening tour last night, our tour guide Kristina greeted most of us and off we went. We were told we could leave the tour at any time, a donation at the end would be appreciated, you can even make a donation by credit card! A TripAdvisor review was requested and appreciated. 
I am not a fan of tours, but this was fun. Kristina's tour had just enough history and humor and she made a point to learn a little bit about each of her guests which I appreciated. Before I knew it the tour was over, hard to believe two hours went by that quickly. I asked her for a dinner recommendation and once again her suggestion to try a traditional Bugarian restaurant was excellent. Our meal at Izbata ( www.izbata.bg) was excellent, try the chicken stuffed with spinach in phyllo or lamb with a minty sauce! Thank you Kristina for making our stay in Sofia a memorable one!";11.07.2015;USA
713;186605Lucy;"My husband and I really enjoyed this walking tour of the city. A much more personal approach than the usual red bus tours in other cities. These tours can be hit or miss. 
We have three days in the city so we have time to return to some of the more interesting places for us, after this tour. It was a very sunny warm morning, so sun protection and water needed plus of course the camera. 
First time to Sofia and can highly recommend it as a city break.

714;Liz J;Went with family - 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. Expected a lot of eye rolling. She loved taking photos and adopted our tour guide Kristina, son loved all the random stories about the historical people. Not a load of stats and boring facts. Entertaining, easy, best way to see Sofia's highlights in easy to consume spoon-feeds of information. In July recommend evening tour as cooler, Sofia is quieter and the evening light is stunning on the golden domes of the Cathedral. The end of the tour was close to the Sense Hotel roof top bar where we watched the sunset, and then over the road to the Victoria Restaurant - delicious food. - the perfect end.;11.07.2015;UK
715;Jade J;"Such a fantastic way to be introduced to a new city! Our guide Vitkoria did an excellent job and was very knowledgable, friendly and made the tour fun with her upbeat personality. Although the group was large we could always hear what she was explaining and we also had time for photos etc between locations. We took the 6pm tour which was perfect as you avoid the hot sun during the day and seeing the final church just as dusk is approaching is beautiful. Definitely take advantage of this excellent free activity and be sure to tip your guide if they do a good job! 
Also at the end we were given a new brochure which the 365 Association has just released, a great map and bits of info on various sights around Sofia, along with other tour and restaurant recommendations. We visited a restaurant mentioned and enjoyed lovely Bulgarian food to finish off the evening however sadly the waitress would not honor the discount that the brochure says we were to receive as she didn't know about it.";12.07.2015;Australia
716;anatidenphobie;This is a fantastic tour around Sofia. I can see why this is such a popular tour, some very interesting information about the history of the place undertaken by a great team of guides and is certainly worthwhile.

717;mch2012;Our guide took us to all the main sites of the city and provided a good overview of the history and culture in Bulgaria. He was friendly and enthusiastic. Great way to get a sense of Sofia.;13.07.2015;Canada
718;ViksG;I'm really not one for following around a yellow clipboard, but given the great reviews, we went along. Takes in most of the attractions in the city centre and helps you orientate yourself. Start and ends in different places, so take a map with you if you've only just arrived so you can get back to where you need to be easily. Helpful, knowledgeable guide Simona made the trip interesting.;14.07.2015;UK

721;StyleCAD;Although my husband and I walked around Sofia by ourselves for first part of our stay, we thought the tour informed us about the history of Sofia. A girl who led our group was very enthusiastic and energetic. She spoke very good English. I was at loss time to time but none the less I learned more about Sofia. I recommend this tour if you're a first time or even if you're a returning visitor. Don't forget to tip the guide at the end of the tour. Not many gave the tip but I think, even just a small amount will be greatly appreciated. Bon Voyage!!;16.07.2015;USA
722;Tinne D;Very Nice! The guide Really knew a lot. You felt like she wanted to show you how Nice Sofia Really are. Good amounth of attractions!;16.07.2015;
723;Joseph B;This tour makes for a perfect introduction to Sofia, especially if, like me, you know relatively little about Sofia and don't have much time to explore it. Our tour guide, Nikola, was extremely knowledgeable, entertaining and good-natured. He really succeeded in making the history of the city accessible, and made me want to return again. Good job!;16.07.2015;
724;Seamus2308;"A great way to get to know the city. Sofia is full of hidden gems but on first appearances can seem intimidating for those not used to the Balkans. The walking tour not only shows you around many beautiful places but also shows you how friendly and beautiful the varied sites of the centre are.
Considering it is free and only ask a tip it is worth all the money you pay :D";17.07.2015;Bulgaria
725;Žiga T;Was recommended to us by our hotel so we gave it a try. It was fun, interesting and informative. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to get to know Sofia a bit better.;17.07.2015;
726;Sybilcrookes;Enthusiastic young people with excellent English lead you round 35 buildings and venues - no time to go inside but you learn enough to know what to go back to at leisure. An ideal introduction to Sofia, which by the way is a very safe city. The silly reviews we had read about packs of marauding dogs and many beggars are just not true. We saw about four beggars and no dogs in our five day stay. A very friendly city;18.07.2015;UK
727;Hannah D;If you have time make sure you do this tour and visit the Vitisha Mountain the views are amazing. Tourist info in the central station is really worth a visit and shop at Billa Supermarkets or Lidl they are great.

728;mjo101;Before taking this tour I spent a whole day alone in the city, and although I saw some of the prominent touristic spots, I felt like I wanted to learn more about the city's history. 10 coins hostel informed me about Free Sofia Tour so I decided to attend the 6 p.m. one. Kristina was my tour guide and from the beginning she made us feel comfortable with each other. Her enthusiasm was contagious and her overall positive attitude made my first free tour ever a wonderful experience. If you plan on taking this tour, aim for the 6 p.m. one because it's not that hot outside and the streets are pretty empty. I met some awesome people in my tour and learned very interesting and funny stories about the city. Thank you Kristina and Free Sofia Tour for the awesome service!;19.07.2015;USA
729;Starviagera;"I was amazed as how few people gave a tip, even after I very openly gave mine because not one person on the morning 365 culture tour gave the guide a tip. It is free! The least you can do is give a tip.

736;Michelle_Ni_Riain;"We were in Sofia for a short visit and really wanted to learn a little about the city. I normally love museums but the weather was glorious outside, and I didn't have the time to read a book. The Free Sofia Tour was the perfect solution; casual but full of interesting information, outdoors but capturing the most significant buildings; not too long but full of anecdotal detail and colourful stories. An extraordinary number of people turned up for the tour, but the guides handled the situation well, splitting up the group and calling in an extra guide at short notice. Our guide was the lovely Kristina, whose in-depth knowledge of her city was surpassed by her charm and willingness to share personal stories with us. The tour covered a small area, distance wise, but years and years of history. Afterwards, we had a sense of understanding the city far better and were able to give a mini tour to our friends as we walked back from dinner that evening. My only regret is that we did the tour on the last night of our trip - had we done it on the first day, our wonderful stay in Sofia would have been all the richer. Thanks for a great tour.";24.07.2015;Ireland
737;northernlighter;This is a must for any visit to Sofia! I can vividly remember the moment when the tour took us to a downtown street corner where 2000 years of history together with many different religions converge among the hustle and bustle of city traffic. It was amazing!;24.07.2015;USA

763;Alain T;"My family was planning a vacation at a beach resort on the black sea. We were traveling by car from Slovakia to Bulgaria and I decided that we would reduce the continuous car time by stopping over in Sofia.

When we got there, the city looked like... Well, not much. I had read about the free Sofia tour and had planned to take it. It fit perfectly in my plans.

I was not sorry and judging by the attendance, word of mouth attracks a great deal of business to them.

I personally loved it! Anna was our tour guide. Her English was better than mine and she new her city and how to make it interesting to all, including my 11 year old daughter.

The tour lasted a little over 2 hours, mostly because she new how to get the group involved and that generated a great deal of interesting questions.

I strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the rich history of Sofia.

Thank you Anna and Free Sofia Tour.";03.08.2015;
764;HAndries;"I did the tour last week (Monday) in the evening. Our guide Alex spoke very good English and led us through Sofia's history and greatest places in a brief and understandable way. 

I liked the fact that this organization works with volunteers that have a normal job or study besides this instead of being all architects and historians, so they can offer a more entertaining point of view rather than going too much into (boring) details.

So, in summary, this tour gives you a good overview of the city, with some nice stories told by the guide. When you do it the first day of your stay in Sofia, it is also a nice starting point after which you can decide to visit some things again, but then more profoundly.";03.08.2015;Belgium
765;Meera_Prashant;"The free Sofia tours are as much about understanding the top few attractions of Sofia as it is about exploring the area slowly and with a local perspective. We did the tour in the end of July, and I totally recommend it. The tour is in excellent English (and on the we did it, the assembled group was so large, that we needed 2 guides). We were from over 5 countries and the guide Christina (I HIGHLY recommend her) did a wonderful smiling job of getting to know us, sheparding us and pointing out little quirky details. She was happy to both answer all kinds of questions and admit her extent of knowledge as required. 

Anyone visiting Sofia, please do this on Day1. It gives you a great idea of what to expect further. 

Since it is free, no complimentary stuff. So, make sure you carry your own bottle of water (esp in summer, even for an Indian!) And do contribute so future travellers can continue to enjoy the tours.";04.08.2015;India

Bring a water bottle to fill up along the way or stop half way in the park to grab a snack from one of the venders along the way. It's not an official stop but you can quickly buy something and rejoin the group.;06.08.2015;USA

Luckily, it was extremely informative and our tour guide Niki was fantastic. He put his own spin on the tour and was very funny. I would say this tour is a must if you are visiting the city. It is brilliant that this is free as it easily compares with the many paid tours I have been on in other cities. Although there was a large number in our group, it felt like a personal experience and was very interactive. I loved it!;08.08.2015;

Slavyan was a proper performer, and really brought the tour to life. There are clearly some standard jokes that they have, and whilst you wince a bit - he moved on quickly to be entertaining - I smiled and laughed a lot.

786;Marcelo_Vindeirinho;My first walking tour in Sofia was with this guys, and it was amazing. In Autumn, days after I arrived to my new living town.

787;Rachael F;"The free Sofia tour was an amazing introduction to an amazing city. Our tour guide Martin mixed his wealth of knowledge about the history of his home in with many of his own stories which gave the tour a very personal feeling. 

The other tours they offer, especially the cultural and communist tour sounded great too, but unfortunately we weren't in Sofia on those days. 

A few incidents occurred during a trip and Martin handled them very well. He obviously cares a lot about his city, it's people and sharing it with people from around the world.";16.08.2015;
788;James D;Over the course of travelling through Europe we've been on more than a dozen of these free tours, but this was definitely the best. The guide Martin was incredible. He made everything interesting and lively, and the incentive of sweets for correct answers was surprisingly rewarding. A truly fantastic experience that I would recommend to anyone travelling through Sofia.;16.08.2015;
789;Agata P;"Our trip with Viki was my first free walking tour experience, and it couldn't have been better. The girl was very well informed, and she was able to share her knowledge in the way that it was both interesting and informative, as well as funny.
We actually visited few of the locations before the tour, but it was nice to get to know more about the city.
The way she presented it, Viki definitely made us fall in love with her city:)

I recommend the tour for anyone who wants to know the city's history and sights without having to spend hours reading travel books.";16.08.2015;
790;Björn O;"I´ve been to Sofia several times but I learned a lot during this 2,5 hours tour. The good thing is that you can do it again and agin. The guide, Nora, was so enthuiastic and did a fantastic job showing the city and explaining the Bulgarian culture.

791;Alina280;"I loved the tour. The tour starts at a building at the end of street Vitosha now, a building with two lions. See more here http://www.freesofiatour.com/ We were around 60 people which I find is a lot :) I never thought Sofia is such a common destination choice. Luckly we were split in three groups, each having it's own guide. 

I had Rodina as a guide (she's the NGO's president). 
Firstly, I appreciated she speaks perfect English. It was a really interractive tour. She had games for us, quizez with special prizes :), lots of interesting things about the buildings, Sofia and Bulgaria. 
Secondly, it was great that I got to see so much of Sofia in so little time (around two hours and 15 minutes) and I got a chance to ask her everything that came to my mind about the country. 
Lastly, there are at least three other tours the organization is offering. I remember something about a cultural tour, a food tour and a communist tour. From my understanding they are paid though, the cultural one was 20 leva I think.";17.08.2015;Romania
792;duka845;Nadya (y) was our host for the free tour. She was amazing, funny, professional tour guide. I did not expect much from a free tour but it went beyond my expectactions. I can only recommend it.;17.08.2015;Budapest

796;P_Maximus;This is a fantastic way of learning about Sofia and Bulgarian history, getting your bearings in the city and some good local advice. Our tour guide Alex was very knowledgeable and friendly. She brought the stories to life. Tours are in (excellent) English. Run twice a day from outside the justice courts. They are free but tips are welcome and deserved. Don't be afraid to ask questions including anything you want to ask a local that isn't part of the tour (where to eat, etc.) as staff are very helpful.;20.08.2015;UK
797;Holly R;Went on this walking tour yesterday evening. Nikola was great and really tried to interact with the group even though we were all a bit quiet.

Definitely recommend this tour!;20.08.2015;
798;Samuel B;This tour gives you an excellent introduction to Sofia. The guides are eloquent, skilled and knowledgeable.

We also took the cultural tour, which is as well interesting and a good way to experience a synthesis of Bulgaria in 2 hours.;20.08.2015;Israel
799;KathrinSinger;We joined today the Free Sofia tour. It was such a good experience. Our guide Dino was great in presenting the amazing history of the city in a charming way, full of anecdotes, luckily hardly any years and dates and all in a very good English. The tour was so inspiring that we joined another tour just some hours later. This time not about sights and history but about culture and food. In short. Sofia is definitely a place worth visiting.;21.08.2015;UK
800;Valentina B;I had very good time walking around Sofia with my tour guide Dino, he was prepared, friendly and also funny. The 365 association is very professional in the organisation of tours even if it is a free tour:first of all we were very much but there were 2 tour guides so we could be splitted in groups, they have their own map and they don't need a reservation, they have this tour twice a day every single day of the year. I highly recommend it;21.08.2015;
801;onur7071;Way better than expected! Our tour guide Daniel was very knowledgeable. Feel free to follow their advices for the rest of our stay in Sofia;22.08.2015;Turkey
802;Yordanka G;Our guide Viki was knowledgeable and funny and the two hours tour was interesting from the beginning to the end. One can learn a lot about Sofia and then continue exploring the city on his/her own. The guides can give you tips about many interesting places to visit. There is no fixed fee for the tour. If you are happy with it, give the guide a few leva (the Bulgarian currency). If not - you are not obliged to pay. I can warmly recommend this tour!;23.08.2015;Sweden
803;Lauren T;"If you are an English speaker wanting to get the most out of visiting Sofia and learning about its history, this is for you. The tour guides are really nice and friendly and tell good stories about the sites. Everything is carefully mapped out so you'll do less walking to see the historical sites. I even learned facts about the buildings that my Bulgarian friend who grew up in Sofia didn't even know.

809;GenerousBklyn;Our guide was enthusiastic and funny. DONT FORGET TO TIP AT THE END. But you will *want* to. A few personal anecdotes gave a feel of it being a live city with real people not just a historical site. Nice efforts to get the guests involved. My excitement about it convinced my local friends to go too! The guide gives a small map with recommended places near the end. We tried restaurant #7 and it was amazing *and* a bargain. I also learned facts that more local friends didn't know. The only way to begin your visit. Highly recommended.;26.08.2015;USA
810;Tarek S;I joined the free walking tour as i do in every city i visit and in fact it was one of my best free tours ever the tour leader Martin told us too much about the Bulgarian history and many stories until our time now + he has a very high sense of humor which we all enjoyed listening while smiling and laughing during the tour. .thanks Martin ..;27.08.2015;

813;eelSeattle;I had never heard of any FREE City Tours before the one in Sofia. Having read about it in an online travel guide for Sofia, I decided to just show up as suggested and give it a try. I could not have been more happily surprised and impressed. During the several hours of walking the central core of the city, we passed by and often stopped at many of the historic churches, buildings, attractions and open spaces. Our young guide was both informative and entertaining. The Free Sofia Tour was an excellent starting point for me to then decide which attractions warranted a return visit for the photo ops, as well as entry. It was very easy to hand my guide a nice tip.;28.08.2015;USA

Thank you Christina for a very well presented tour. she made it interesting and with a little humor as well. So good in fact I can still remember most of the facts!!!! This is a free tour but you can donate a contribution at the end if you wish, this is just to keep the tour going as these are all volunteers.

837;clemc;"Take this tour first and then explore the old town center. The tour took us all around the old town area and our tour guide Dino was funny and full of information. I do recommend asking the tour guide to draw on your map the route he lead so you could go back and revisit and spend more time in the places that interested you. The tour is free but by no mean it is low on quality. I would pay to take this tour.

842;Jim M;The free Sofia tour is just that -- a free guided tour of some the city's highlights. I found it fun and very interesting. Perhaps the best recommendation is that some locals have taken the tour and have really liked it. Our tour was about 1.5 hours and it covered the city's major attractions. Of course, donations are accepted at the end of the tour, but there was no pressure and I was happy to contribute since it was such a positive experience.

869;Russell H;Being absolute strangers to Bulgarian culture the free tour was fantastic.We found out from our host. Simply met at a set point and followed a very well prepared and interesting guide around.Expect to pay something to the guide, which in our case was well deserved.;03.10.2015;Australia
870;bukson1502;We had a great experience with our guide Nadya. Really recomended. She show us in a very unique way the main sites of Sofia followed with history, urban legends and other things which you dont find on books or the web. Thanks for a wonderfull morning.;03.10.2015;Israel
871;TaistealBoy;Best way to start off your first day in Sofia. Our guide, Slav was entertaining and informative. we had a great morning with him !;04.10.2015;
872;Shimrit_E1975;If you are in Sofia for the first time,like we fid, you must take this free tour-leaves twice a day -at 11:00 and 18:00 -from the supreme court building. We had an amazing tour guide named Radina -who really made this tour a wonderful experience. Very recommended;04.10.2015;Israel
873;HilliardSonographer;We had a wonderful time on this tour with Dino today. He's funny, interesting & very knowledgable. It took exactly 2 hours, but the time just flew by. Make sure you check this out. You won't regret it.;04.10.2015;
874;A TripAdvisor Member;The tour with Radina was amazing. She knows lots of things about the city and she really makes you to have a good time. Excellent.;06.10.2015;
875;FQT;"This was one of the highlights of our week long business trip to Sofia. Due to work commitments, the evening timing was great. Our guide, Ani, was fantastic - she shared lots of interesting/amusing stories of the sights and history. We were lucky enough that our tour coincided with a concert in front of the national theatre (beautiful building), complete with a performance by one of the best Bulgarian rock bands and fireworks! An unexpected treat. The tour is really good to help you get your bearings and decide future self-guided excursions.

An interesting mix of nationalities participated in our tour which I appreciated as you could hear different interpretations and experiences from different nationalities.";06.10.2015;Japan
876;Siobhan N;The guide Martin made this for me! A walking tour can always be a good way to get an informative, interesting, and local perspective on a place, but when the personality showing you is as warm and fun as Martin's you get all of that and more. Loved the couple of hours spent walking around sofia, i learnt so much, and had a good laugh and a lot of smiles along the way. Thankyou Martin, highly recommend this walking tour;07.10.2015;
877;Nlenigma;Large group Martin seemed a bit annoying at first but was a genuinely caring and passionate soul Tour started a bit late in the day as it was dark half way through Was fascinating though and gave good insight on Sofia history and arcitexture;09.10.2015;Canada
878;Manon H;"Martin was our guide for a bit more than 2 hours. Eventhough we were a huge group this time, he managed to make the tour very personal. Mixing history, description, jokes and anecdotes, he introduced us to his city with passion ! 
I highly recommand this tour, it's a good way to have a overview on the city and understand its very interesting history ! And really, it was 2 hours of fun with him !";09.10.2015;Germany
879;shawninottawa68;Very knowledgeable tour guide. Great way to spend a few hours. Victoria was our guide and she was able to share a lot of information. It is an easy walk but some stairs. Highly recommend;11.10.2015;Canada
880;Rafael Z;The Free Sofia Tour is the best way to see all the main attractions of the city, get some recommendations on some others and discover the hidden secrets of the Bulgarian capital. Martin, our guide, was amazing, and managed to hold and entertain and teach a group of more than 40 people for more than 2 hours. Definitely recommend it!;12.10.2015;
881;Zikata;I'm from Sofia and went with a visitor from Scotland. I'm shocked and amazed at how much I learned about my own city! This tour is a must do!;13.10.2015;Bulgaria
882;mightygeo;It is a free 2 hour tour that goes at casual pace walking to the main sites in Sofia. They don't go in any of the places, but they give you the history, times, and prices if you want to come back and visit any of them. They do a great job keeping it interesting. They do appreciate a tip at the end. If you go on the 11am tour, ask the guide where the balkin bite tour starts. That tour starts at 2pm about 4 blocks from where the walking tour ends. That tour lets you try Bulgarian food and gives you insight to some things off the beaten track. The bonus is that tour actually ends in the location that the walking tour started. Both tours together give you a fun and insight day to Bulgarian life. I recommend both.;13.10.2015;USA
883;Jesus M;We had a lovely tour and our guide Viktoria was very friendly and she knew lots of interesting things about the city, this free tour is a must in Sofia.;13.10.2015;Qatar
884;Simon P;Smart guide. Seen from a western point of view the information provided during the tour about the country's political past can be called balanced...;14.10.2015;Germany
885;Norman Y;"Nikola was very good in Sofia history, great walking tour. We took the one at 6:00 pm, the late part getting dark, suggest to start at 5:00 pm.
He gave us a rough idea what we can visit again on next date, it was very good then we also took the Communist tour on next day with him again. Both are very enjoyable.";15.10.2015;
886;Catherine W;Offered twice a day at 11am and 6pm, the Free Sofia Tour is a must for anyone who wants to learn about the city and be introduced to its main attractions. The guide was a local who was highly knowledgeable, engaging, personable and a great storyteller. She made Sofia's history come to life for her very large audience. I recommend this to all visitors with a couple hours to spare - a fabulous introduction to the city!;16.10.2015;
887;Agnieszka800425;It was just the best tour I ever had. Our guide - Radina was so nice and so entusiastic about Sofia that we forgot about the bad weather. I enjoyed this tour very much and I truly recommend it to everybody who will visit Sofia :-);16.10.2015;Poland
888;Nrarp;"I have been to Sofia with my son (21 year old) and we took the free Sofia tour.
We have walked through the churches, mosque, and synagogue in the streets of Sofia. We felt the history of the empires and the atmosphere of the statues, buildings, palace, and mountain nearby. We heard the stories about Boris the 3rd, the monarch, the communists and world war 2.It was real pleasure to discover the known and hidden parts of the city. Our guide, Victoria knew the way how to merge history, art, architecture, communists, humor and lion stories in a very intelligent and interesting way.";18.10.2015;Israel
889;Meltem Ö;Actually, I have been to sofia 2 times. At first, we did not know about this tour but then we found this during our second visit to sofia. It was really great. In my opinion, it should be the first thing during your sofia visit. Join the tour and have a general idea about the places, city and known things actually which are wrong. It takes 2 h. Meet the group at the palace of justice. It happens twice in a day. Guides are very friendly and have knowledge about their city. Our guide was Alex. She was very nice, helpful and well informed. We visited important parts of the city and learned what we didnt know about the city. After the tour, you can decide the places that you want to see more detailed.;18.10.2015;
890;hassan s;You can't visit Sofia without taking the Free walking tour .I've been to Bulgaria mid SEP. 2015 where I found Sofia one of the most friendly capitals I've ever visited. Start your visit to Sofia with the free walking tour which will introduce thousands of years history in couple of hours , then you can spend two more days I Sofia heading to all the attraction points you've seen during your tour one by one as they are all worth seeing and the free walking tour will only stops outside the attraction points without entering it , so you better come again later. Recommended;20.10.2015;UAE
891;TurboBobi;"I am from Sofia and a colleague of mine recommended that I take our guest from Russia to the free tour.
The group for the tour turned out to be a total of 40 people from different nationalities - Belgian, German, English, Indian, Russian, etc. Our tour guide was Kristina.

The route took us through most of the inner city center stressing on the ancient and recent history of the places that we saw left and right.
The tour is outdoors only - the guide states this explicitly. It's cool that she told us which of the places that we saw can be visited as museums.

What to bring to the tour: definitely a camera. A lot of architectural wonders to behold and from different angels too!
Check out the weather forecast before taking the tour - it's 2 hours long so you don't want to freeze or be sweaty by the time it's over.

Best parts: very good route; knowledgeable, professional, positive guide who handled with care a group of 40(!) people on a late and chilly autumn afternoon. Very good sense of pace and positioning for the lectures.
Worst part: during two of the stops for a lecture, there was some or a lot of background noise so we couldn't hear Kristina very well.

I do have some recommendations for places that can be included in the tour:
- the Bulgarian Parlament - it's near the destination of the tour so it can at least be mentioned if someone wants to see it. It's a beautiful building and the Tzar Osvoboditel square is also very nice.
- the National Library - it's also near Alexander Nevski so it can at least be mentioned as a subsequent visit.
- the National Theater Ivan Vazov - it's a very beatiful building with an awesome facade and a nice fountain and part in front of it.
- the Halls of Commerse (Halite) - it's a shopping hall within a well renovated building.";22.10.2015;Bulgaria
892;MAKLondon;Alex, the tour guide, gave us a well presented, fun but very informative tour covering the main central sites and helping us to get our bearings. The tour group was engaged through questions as well as a historical game! Great first thing to do in Sofia - now off to investigate some of the sights in more detail.;24.10.2015;UK
893;A TripAdvisor Member;We had daniele and he was excellent. Although I took it later in my holiday it was still worth it. Best to know beforehand there is a lot of climbing up and down steps. And don't be mean with your donation!;25.10.2015;
894;Gila_11;Great tour! Takes you to the main city attractions with interesting history stories that our guide Dessy told us so nicely... It was a pleasure and we highly recommend this tour :-);24.10.2015;Israel
895;Davi3e;This is a great free tour that motivates you to go into the city centre and visit some other sights on your own later on. It's pleasant with the just right amount of history so it does not get boring for all those of us that are not too much into the details. :);26.10.2015;Slovenia
896;Shannon P;We were intrigued by Martin's in-depth historical knowledge and zest for showing us his city. We really enjoyed his take on Bulgaria!;25.10.2015;Australia
897;dorvelbg;The tour is great, taking you to the main sights in about 2 hours that fly by so fast! :) The guide took the time to tell some unknown facts about the tour's stop points, but also answered all kinds of questions by the group. I joined one of their special tours in Bulgarian (part of their anniversary tours) and felt like I was in a foreign city.;25.10.2015;Bulgaria
898;InspectorHoward;Enjoyed a cheerful day in Sofia. Bright and animated tour with Ani. Like the best performers she finished with a song. Delightful and just enough to see the best bits of Sofia.;27.10.2015;UK
899;KiwiKara;Absolutely loved this walking tour. We were taken to the main sights of the city and given a great history lesson as well as some fantastic, local-in-the-know tidbits as we wandered round the city. We loved Ani's enthusiasm and she was so helpful at the end giving advice!;29.10.2015;UK
900;Kate M;I really enjoyed this walking tour. I did the free walking tour with Ani, and then the Culture tour (not free) with Christina. The walking tour was a great introduction to Sofia. We saw the main sites, learned a lot of history, and it helped me to get my bearings around the city. Ani was also super helpful with information about restaurants and the city. The Culture Tour was also a lot of fun. It's not expensive, and you get to try some traditional food and drinks, try traditional dancing, and learn about different aspects of Bulgarian culture you probably wouldn't otherwise.;29.10.2015;
901;Alison B;Our guide was called Christina who was a Bulgarian who lives in Sofia and volunteers. She made the tour very personal with stories from her grandparents and parents. We were introduced to most of the important sights in Sofia and she made it fun and interactive. My daughter had done the tour the week before with her friend and said she had a different tour guide who was also very good. We were free to ask questions throughout the tour and my daughter and I strongly recommend this tour. (For those in wheelchairs the route would be difficult lots of steps);30.10.2015;UK
902;Norbs1971;We had the guide Ani who was fantastic , very passionate and very interesting . We covered a relatively short distance but got to see the majority of the sites , Thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend this tour to everyone . You would be crazy to miss it .;31.10.2015;UK
